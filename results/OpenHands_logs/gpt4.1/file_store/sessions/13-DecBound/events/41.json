However, if there is a direct path to\nany negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate\nto point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to\ngenerate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out\nthat a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train\nmodels that generate Deepfakes faster.\n\u2022The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is\nbeing used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the\ntechnology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following\nfrom (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.\n\u2022If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation\nstrategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,\nmechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from\nfeedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).\n11.Safeguards\nQuestion: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible\nrelease of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,\nimage generators, or scraped datasets)?\nAnswer: [NA]\nJustification: NA\nGuidelines:\n\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.\n\u2022Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with\nnecessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring\nthat users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing\nsafety filters.\n\u2022Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors\nshould describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.\n\u2022We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do\nnot require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best\nfaith effort.\n12.Licenses for existing assets\nQuestion: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in\nthe paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and\nproperly respected?\nAnswer: [Yes] ,\nJustification: Yes, we cited every dataset and models we used.\nGuidelines:\n\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.\n\u2022 The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.\n\u2022The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a\nURL.\n\u2022 The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.\n\u2022For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of\nservice of that source should be provided.\n\u2022If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the\npackage should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets\nhas curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the\nlicense of a dataset.\n\u2022For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of\nthe derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.\n24\n[Jupyter current working directory: /workspace/benchmark/datasets]\n[Jupyter Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]", "extras": {"code": "# Try page 23 for Appendix G (page 23)\nprint(reader.pages[23].extract_text())"}, "success": true}
