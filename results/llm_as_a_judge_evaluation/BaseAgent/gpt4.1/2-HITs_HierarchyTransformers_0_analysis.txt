The function implemented by the coding agent in src/hierarchy_transformers/losses/hit_loss.py is not fully implemented for the forward methods of HyperbolicClusteringLoss and HyperbolicCentripetalLoss: both are left as pass. In the golden file, these methods are also left as pass, so in this respect, the files are equivalent.

However, the main forward method in HierarchyTransformerLoss is fully implemented in the golden file, computing the cluster and centripetal losses directly in the forward method, rather than using the HyperbolicClusteringLoss and HyperbolicCentripetalLoss modules. In the agent's implementation, the forward method instantiates and calls these modules, but since their forward methods are not implemented (just pass), the returned cluster_loss and centri_loss are always None. This means the combined_loss will always be 0.0, regardless of the input, which is incorrect.

In the golden file, the actual loss computation is performed in the forward method of HierarchyTransformerLoss, so the loss values are meaningful.

Therefore, the implementation logic in the agent's file is incorrect: the loss is never computed, and the output is always zero.
