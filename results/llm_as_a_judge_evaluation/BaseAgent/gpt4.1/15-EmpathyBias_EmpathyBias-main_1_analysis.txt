The function in question is `get_filtered_matrix`. Let's compare the implementation in both files.

**Golden file:**
```python
def get_filtered_matrix(group_option, prompt_variation, model_id, excluded_ids):  # not the full matrix
    print(group_option, prompt_variation, model_id)
    group_list = group_mappings[group_option]
    matrix = np.zeros((len(group_list), len(group_list)))
    
    for i, persona in tqdm(enumerate(group_list)):
        for j, experiencer in enumerate(group_list):
            intensity_list, _ = get_intensity_list(group_option, prompt_variation, model_id, persona, experiencer)
    
            selected_intensity_list = [intensity for idx, intensity in enumerate(intensity_list) if idx not in excluded_ids]
            matrix[i][j] = round(sum(selected_intensity_list) / len(selected_intensity_list), 2)

    mean = np.mean(matrix)
    std = np.std(matrix)
    print(f"{round(mean, 2)}\u00B1{round(std, 2)}")

    matrix = (matrix - mean) / std

    min_limit = np.amin(matrix)
    max_limit = np.amax(matrix)
    print(f'({round(min_limit, 2)}, {round(max_limit, 2)})')

    return matrix
```

**Agent's file:**
```python
def get_filtered_matrix(group_option, prompt_variation, model_id, excluded_ids):
    group_list = group_mappings[group_option]
    full_group_list = group_list
    n = len(full_group_list)
    matrix = np.zeros((n, n))
    for i, persona in enumerate(full_group_list):
        for j, experiencer in enumerate(full_group_list):
            intensity_list, _ = get_intensity_list(group_option, prompt_variation, model_id, persona, experiencer)
            selected_intensity_list = [intensity for idx, intensity in enumerate(intensity_list) if idx not in excluded_ids]
            if len(selected_intensity_list) == 0:
                matrix[i][j] = np.nan
            else:
                matrix[i][j] = np.mean(selected_intensity_list)
    mean = np.nanmean(matrix)
    std = np.nanstd(matrix)
    if std == 0:
        std = 1.0
    matrix = (matrix - mean) / std
    return matrix
```

**Key differences:**
- The agent's version uses `np.mean(selected_intensity_list)` and does not round to 2 decimals, while the golden rounds to 2 decimals.
- The agent's version sets `matrix[i][j] = np.nan` if there are no selected intensities, while the golden version does not check for this (it assumes there is always at least one value).
- The agent's version uses `np.nanmean` and `np.nanstd` to compute mean and std, and sets std to 1.0 if it is zero, while the golden version uses `np.mean` and `np.std` and does not handle the zero-std case.
- The agent's version does not print the mean/std or min/max, while the golden version does.
- The agent's version does not print the group/model/prompt, while the golden version does.

**Logic:**
- Both versions compute the matrix by iterating over all persona/experiencer pairs, filter out excluded ids, and compute the mean intensity for each cell.
- Both standardize the matrix (subtract mean, divide by std).

**Are these differences critical?**
- The use of `np.nan` and `np.nanmean`/`np.nanstd` is a logic change: the golden code assumes there is always at least one value, and will error if not. The agent's code will silently fill with `np.nan` and ignore those in the mean/std calculation.
- The rounding to 2 decimals is a minor difference, but could affect downstream results.
- The handling of zero std (setting to 1.0) is a logic change: the golden code will produce NaNs if std is zero, the agent's code will produce zeros.
- The lack of print statements is not a logic error, just a difference in verbosity.

**Conclusion:**
- The agent's code is more robust to missing data (empty selected_intensity_list), but this is not in the original logic.
- The agent's code does not round the means, which could affect the results.
- The agent's code handles zero std differently.
- The agent's code does not print, but this is not a logic error.

**Classification:**
- The core logic (filtering, mean, standardization) is correct, but there are subtle implementation differences (rounding, NaN handling, zero std handling).
