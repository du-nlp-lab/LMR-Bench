The implementation logic of the function by the coding agent is mostly correct: it takes hidden states from different layers, concatenates them, splits into train/test, fits a logistic regression classifier, and computes accuracy, F1, and AUC for each layer. However, there are some subtle implementation differences compared to the golden file:

1. **Train/Test Split Ratio**:  
   - Coding agent uses `test_size=0.2` (i.e., 80% train, 20% test).
   - Golden file uses `test_size=0.4` (i.e., 60% train, 40% test).
   - This affects the evaluation and may lead to different results.

2. **Stratification**:  
   - Coding agent uses `stratify=y` in `train_test_split`.
   - Golden file does not use stratification.
   - This can affect the class balance in train/test splits.

3. **Logistic Regression Parameters**:  
   - Coding agent uses `solver='liblinear'`, `max_iter=1000`, `random_state=42`.
   - Golden file uses default parameters (no solver, no max_iter, no random_state).
   - These differences can affect reproducibility and convergence.

4. **Exception Handling for AUC**:  
   - Coding agent uses a try/except block to set AUC to 0.5 if an error occurs.
   - Golden file does not handle exceptions for AUC computation.

5. **F1 Score Calculation**:  
   - Coding agent uses default `f1_score(y_test, y_pred)`, which defaults to 'binary' for binary classification.
   - Golden file explicitly sets `average='binary'`, but for binary classification, this is equivalent.

6. **Use of tqdm**:  
   - Coding agent wraps the loop with tqdm for progress bar.
   - Golden file does not.

7. **Classifier Variable Name**:  
   - Coding agent uses `clf`.
   - Golden file uses `classifier`.
   - This is a stylistic difference.

8. **Comments and Print Statements**:  
   - Golden file has more comments and some print statements (commented out).
   - Coding agent's code is more concise.

**Summary**:  
All of these differences are subtle and do not fundamentally change the logic of the function: both implementations perform probing using logistic regression on hidden states from each layer and compute the same metrics. The main logic is preserved, but the differences in train/test split ratio, stratification, and logistic regression parameters could lead to different results and may be considered subtle implementation errors.

Therefore, the correct classification is:
