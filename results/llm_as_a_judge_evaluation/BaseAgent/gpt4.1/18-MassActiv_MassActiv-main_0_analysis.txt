Let's compare the two implementations step by step.

**1. Layer Indexing and Custom Block Enabling**
- Both files convert the 1-based `layer_id` to 0-based index for internal use.
- Both enable the custom block via `mp.enable_vit_custom_block(layer, layer_idx)` (agent) or `mp.enable_vit_custom_block(layer, layer_id)` (golden). The variable names differ, but the value is the same.

**2. Image Loading and Preprocessing**
- Both load the image from `assets/bird.png`, apply `val_transform`, add batch dimension, and move to CUDA.

**3. Model Forward Pass**
- Both use `with torch.no_grad(): output = model(img)` (golden) or `with torch.no_grad(): _ = model(img)` (agent). The output variable is unused, so this is fine.

**4. Feature Extraction**
- Golden: `feat_abs = layers[layer_id].feat.abs()`
- Agent: `feat_abs = layer.feat.abs().cpu()`
- The agent version moves the tensor to CPU immediately, the golden version does not (but does so before pickling).

**5. Saving Inputs**
- Golden: 
  ```python
  inputs = {
      'layer_id': layer_id + 1,
      'model_family': model_family,
      'model_size': model_size,
      'savedir': savedir
  }
  with open(os.path.join(savedir, f"run_exp1_inputs_layer_{layer_id+1}.pkl"), "wb") as f:
      pickle.dump(inputs, f)
  ```
- Agent:
  ```python
  inputs_dict = {'layer_id': layer_id, 'model_family': model_family, 'model_size': model_size, 'img_path': img_path, 'savedir': savedir}
  with open(os.path.join(savedir, f'run_exp1_inputs_layer_{layer_id}.pkl'), 'wb') as f:
      pickle.dump(inputs_dict, f)
  ```
- Differences:
  - The agent saves `layer_id` as the 0-based index, while the golden saves as 1-based (original input).
  - The agent includes `img_path` in the dict, the golden does not.
  - The agent's filename uses `{layer_id}` (0-based), the golden uses `{layer_id+1}` (1-based).

**6. Saving Feature Activations**
- Golden: 
  ```python
  with open(os.path.join(savedir, f"feat_abs_layer_{layer_id+1}.pkl"), "wb") as f:
      pickle.dump(feat_abs.cpu().numpy(), f)
  ```
- Agent:
  ```python
  with open(os.path.join(savedir, f'feat_abs_layer_{layer_id}.pkl'), 'wb') as f:
      pickle.dump(feat_abs, f)
  ```
- Differences:
  - The agent saves the tensor (on CPU), the golden saves the numpy array.
  - The agent's filename uses `{layer_id}` (0-based), the golden uses `{layer_id+1}` (1-based).

**7. Visualization**
- Both call `lib.plot_3d_feat_vit(feat_abs, layer_id, model_family, model_size, savedir)`. The golden passes the tensor (on CUDA), the agent passes the tensor (on CPU). This may or may not matter depending on the implementation of `plot_3d_feat_vit`.

**Summary of Issues:**
- The agent's implementation uses 0-based indexing for filenames and saved `layer_id`, while the golden uses 1-based (matching the input argument).
- The agent saves the feature tensor as a torch tensor, the golden saves as a numpy array.
- The agent includes `img_path` in the input dict, the golden does not.
- The agent's `inputs_dict` and file naming are inconsistent with the golden file, which could break downstream reproducibility or analysis scripts expecting the golden format.

**Conclusion:**
The implementation logic is correct (the right steps are performed), but there are subtle implementation errors regarding file naming, index conventions, and data formats.
