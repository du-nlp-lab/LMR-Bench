Let's analyze the function in question: remove_object_subject_overlap.

Golden implementation:
```python
def remove_object_subject_overlap(
    parametric_knowledge_dataset: pd.DataFrame, string_similarity_ratio=0.8
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """this function deletes the examples where the subject and the parametric object are similar using
    a Jaro-Winkler string similarity.

    Args:
        parametric_knowledge_dataset (pd.DataFrame): the parametric knowledge dataset
        string_similarity_ratio (float, optional): the threshold to use in the Jaro-Winkler string distance. Defaults to 0.8.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: the new parametric knowledge dataset with no similar objects and subjects.
    """

    have_overlap = parametric_knowledge_dataset.apply(
        lambda row: detect_subject_object_overlap(
            row["statement_subject"], row["parametric_object"], string_similarity_threshold=string_similarity_ratio
        ),
        axis=1,
    )

    return parametric_knowledge_dataset[~have_overlap]
```

Agent implementation:
```python
def remove_object_subject_overlap(parametric_knowledge_dataset: pd.DataFrame, string_similarity_ratio=0.8) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """this function deletes the examples where the subject and the parametric object are similar using
    a Jaro-Winkler string similarity.

    Args:
        parametric_knowledge_dataset (pd.DataFrame): the parametric knowledge dataset
        string_similarity_ratio (float, optional): the threshold to use in the Jaro-Winkler string distance. Defaults to 0.8.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: the new parametric knowledge dataset with no similar objects and subjects.
    """

    def is_overlap(row):
        subj = row['statement_subject']
        obj = row['parametric_object']
        if not isinstance(subj, str) or not isinstance(obj, str):
            return True
        return JaroWinkler.normalized_similarity(subj, obj) >= string_similarity_ratio or subj.lower() in obj.lower() or obj.lower() in subj.lower()
    mask = parametric_knowledge_dataset.apply(is_overlap, axis=1)
    filtered_df = parametric_knowledge_dataset[~mask].reset_index(drop=True)
    return filtered_df
```

Key differences:
- The agent's implementation inverts the order of the substring check and the similarity check compared to the golden detect_subject_object_overlap, but the logic is the same (OR between substring and similarity).
- The agent's implementation adds a check: if not isinstance(subj, str) or not isinstance(obj, str): return True. This means that if either is not a string, the row is considered as "overlap" and will be dropped.
- The golden implementation does not reset the index after filtering, while the agent's does.
- The golden implementation uses the detect_subject_object_overlap function, which is also present in the agent's file, but the agent's remove_object_subject_overlap does not use it directly, instead inlines the logic.

Are these differences significant?
- The check for non-string types: The golden implementation asserts both are strings, so if not, it will raise an error. The agent's implementation will drop such rows. This is a subtle difference: the agent's is more robust to bad data, but may silently drop rows, while the golden will error.
- The reset_index: This is a minor difference, but could affect downstream code if index is important.
- Not using the helper function: This is not a logic error, just a code organization difference.

Conclusion:
- The logic for overlap detection is correct.
- The only differences are: handling of non-string types (drop vs error), and index resetting.
- These are subtle implementation differences, not logic errors.

Therefore, the correct classification is:
