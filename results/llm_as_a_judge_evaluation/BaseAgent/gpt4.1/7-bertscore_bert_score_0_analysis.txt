Let's compare the two implementations step by step:

**1. Embedding Normalization**
- Golden: In-place division by L2 norm along the last dimension (div_).
- Agent: Uses torch.nn.functional.normalize(ref_embedding, p=2, dim=-1), which is equivalent but not in-place. This is fine.

**2. Similarity Matrix**
- Golden: sim = torch.bmm(hyp_embedding, ref_embedding.transpose(1, 2))
- Agent: sim = torch.bmm(ref_embedding, hyp_embedding.transpose(1, 2))
- This is a key difference: the agent computes sim as (ref, hyp^T), while the golden computes (hyp, ref^T). This will swap the axes, which affects the max operations later.

**3. Masking**
- Golden: 
  - masks = torch.bmm(hyp_masks.unsqueeze(2).float(), ref_masks.unsqueeze(1).float())
  - masks is then expanded and applied to sim.
- Agent:
  - ref_mask and hyp_mask are extracted from the input masks, then valid_mask = ref_mask_unsq * hyp_mask_unsq, and sim is masked accordingly.
- The masking logic is different. The agent's masking is not equivalent to the golden's, and the dimensions may not align as intended.

**4. Max Operations**
- Golden:
  - word_precision = sim.max(dim=2)[0]  # max over reference words for each hyp word
  - word_recall = sim.max(dim=1)[0]     # max over hyp words for each ref word
- Agent:
  - r_max, _ = sim.max(dim=2)  # max over hyp words for each ref word
  - p_max, _ = sim.max(dim=1)  # max over ref words for each hyp word
- Because the sim matrix is transposed compared to the golden, the max operations are swapped. This is a logic error.

**5. IDF Normalization**
- Golden: hyp_idf.div_(hyp_idf.sum(dim=1, keepdim=True)), ref_idf.div_(ref_idf.sum(dim=1, keepdim=True))
- Agent: No normalization, just multiplies by the mask and sums.

**6. F1 Calculation**
- Golden: F = 2 * P * R / (P + R)
- Agent: F_bertscore = 2 * p * r / (p + r + 1e-08)
- The agent adds a small epsilon to avoid division by zero, which is fine.

**7. NaN Handling**
- Golden: F_bertscore = F.masked_fill(torch.isnan(F), 0.0)
- Agent: No explicit NaN handling.

**Conclusion:**
- The agent's implementation swaps the axes in the similarity matrix and the max operations, which is a logic error.
- The masking and IDF normalization are also not equivalent.
- Therefore, the implementation logic is incorrect.
