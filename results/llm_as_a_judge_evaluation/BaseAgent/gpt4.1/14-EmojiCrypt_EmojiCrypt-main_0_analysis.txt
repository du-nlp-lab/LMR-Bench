The function implemented by the coding agent and the golden file both aim to compute the mean cosine similarity between pairs of original and decrypted feature levels, using OpenAI embeddings and cosine similarity.

Key points of comparison:

- **Embedding Calculation**: The agent's implementation actually calls the OpenAI API to get embeddings for both the original and decrypted values, and computes cosine similarity between them. The golden file, in its final version, uses mock embeddings (random vectors) for both, but the commented-out code shows the intended use of OpenAI embeddings, matching the agent's approach.
- **Saving Results**: The agent's implementation saves both the enc_dec_pairs and the results to pickle files, while the golden file comments out these lines (but the intent is present).
- **Return Value**: Both return the mean cosine similarity.
- **Input/Output**: Both take enc_dec_pairs as input, and optionally output to a file.
- **Correctness of Logic**: The agent's implementation is logically correct and matches the intended use as per the paper and the repository: for each pair, get embeddings, compute cosine similarity, sum, average, and return.

**Subtle differences**:
- The agent's implementation actually uses the OpenAI API, while the golden file (in the code shown) uses random vectors for demonstration/testing purposes, but the intended logic is the same.
- The agent's implementation saves the enc_dec_pairs to a file, which is not strictly necessary for the cosine similarity computation, but does not affect correctness.
- The agent's implementation prints the mean cosine similarity, which is fine.

**Conclusion**: The implementation logic is correct and matches the intended standard implementation, with only minor differences in file saving and print statements, which do not affect the core logic.
