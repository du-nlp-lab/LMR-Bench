The function in question is `generate_counter_parametric_knowledge_dataset`.

Let's compare the two implementations:

**Golden implementation:**
- Calls `get_objects_to_first_token_id_dict(parametric_knowledge)` to get `object_to_first_token_id`.
- Iterates over each row in `parametric_knowledge` and for each, calls `build_counter_parametric_knowledge` with:
    - statement_subject
    - rel_lemma
    - statement_object
    - relation_group_id
    - parametric_object
    - statement
    - parametric_object_first_token_log_probas_distribution (from `log_probability_parametric_object_first_token`)
    - nb_counter_parametric_knowledge
    - all_dataset_objects_to_their_first_token_id (from `object_to_first_token_id`)
    - parametric_knowledge_rel (the subset of parametric_knowledge with the same rel_lemma)
- Collects all results into a list, then creates a DataFrame.

**Agent implementation:**
- Does not call `get_objects_to_first_token_id_dict`.
- Instead, it builds several dictionaries mapping rel_lemma to lists of various columns.
- For each row, it:
    - Gets the rel_lemma, subject, correct_object.
    - Builds a list of possible counter objects by filtering out the correct object and the subject.
    - Further filters out objects that are too similar to the subject.
    - Randomly selects up to `nb_counter_parametric_knowledge` counter objects.
    - For each, finds the corresponding row in the DataFrame and builds a dictionary with a large number of fields, including both the original and counter fields.
- Returns a DataFrame of these rows.

**Key differences:**
- The golden implementation delegates the logic of building counter-parametric knowledge to `build_counter_parametric_knowledge`, which is likely to encapsulate the correct logic and structure, and passes the full parametric_knowledge subset for the relation.
- The agent implementation reimplements the logic for selecting counter objects, and manually builds the output rows, including both original and counter fields.
- The agent implementation does not use `get_objects_to_first_token_id_dict`, and does not pass the correct `parametric_object_first_token_log_probas_distribution` (it uses `row['parametric_object_first_token_log_probas_distribution']` if present, but the golden implementation expects `log_probability_parametric_object_first_token`).
- The agent implementation's output DataFrame has a different structure: it includes both original and counter fields, while the golden implementation's output is determined by `build_counter_parametric_knowledge`.

**Conclusion:**
- The agent's implementation does not follow the intended logic of the golden implementation, as it does not use the core function (`build_counter_parametric_knowledge`) and does not pass the correct arguments.
- The output structure is different.
- The logic for selecting counter objects is reimplemented and may not match the intended behavior.

Therefore, the implementation logic is incorrect.
