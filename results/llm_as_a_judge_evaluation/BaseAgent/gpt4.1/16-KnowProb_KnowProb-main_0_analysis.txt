The implementation logic in the coding agent's file is incorrect compared to the golden file. Here are the key issues:

1. **Data Handling and Splitting**:
   - The golden file splits the DataFrame by relation group using DataFrame filtering and then calls `undersample_dataset` on the DataFrame, followed by `get_features_and_targets_for_dataset` for each split. The agent's code, however, first calls `get_features_and_targets_for_dataset` on the whole DataFrame, then splits the resulting arrays by index. This is a significant logic difference: the golden file's approach allows for correct undersampling and feature extraction per group, while the agent's approach may mix up the mapping between features, targets, and relation groups, and may not properly undersample per group.

2. **Label Encoding**:
   - The golden file explicitly passes a `label_encoder` to `get_features_and_targets_for_dataset`, ensuring consistent label mapping. The agent's code does not do this, which could lead to inconsistent or incorrect label encoding.

3. **Parallelization Granularity**:
   - The golden file parallelizes over layers within each relation group, while the agent's code parallelizes over relation groups and then loops over layers. This changes the parallelization granularity and may affect performance, but more importantly, it reflects a different structure of computation.

4. **Return Type and Function Signature**:
   - The golden file's docstring and function signature indicate that the function returns a list of dicts, but the agent's code has a different approach to collecting and returning results, which may not match the expected output structure.

5. **Print Statements and Verbosity**:
   - The golden file includes print statements for progress tracking, which are missing in the agent's code. While not critical for correctness, this is a difference in user feedback.

6. **Backend and n_jobs in Parallel**:
   - The golden file uses `n_jobs=12, backend="loky", verbose=10` for `Parallel`, while the agent's code uses `n_jobs=-1` and omits backend and verbosity. This is a minor difference but could affect reproducibility and debugging.

7. **Use of DataFrame Index**:
   - The golden file resets the DataFrame index at the start, which can be important for correct row referencing. The agent's code does not do this.

Because of these differences, especially in how the data is split and features/targets are extracted, the agent's implementation does not correctly replicate the logic of the golden file and may produce incorrect results.
