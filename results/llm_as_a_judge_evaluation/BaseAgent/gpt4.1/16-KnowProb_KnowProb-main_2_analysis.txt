The function implemented by the coding agent is not fully equivalent to the standard implementation.

Analysis:

- The golden implementation checks if the parametric_object (lowercased) is present in either the generation_object_1 or generation_subject_1 columns (both lowercased). If it is present in either, it returns False (i.e., the object is in the prompt); if not in both, it returns True.
- The agent's implementation only checks the generation_object_1 column, and does not consider generation_subject_1 at all.
- The agent's implementation also uses set membership, which is fine for efficiency, but the main issue is the missing check for generation_subject_1.
- The docstring in the agent's implementation also only refers to generation_object_1, not both columns.

Therefore, the implementation logic is incorrect because it does not fully check for the presence of the parametric_object in all relevant columns as required by the standard.
