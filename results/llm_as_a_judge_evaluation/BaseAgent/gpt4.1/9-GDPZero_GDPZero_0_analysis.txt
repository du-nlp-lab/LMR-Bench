The function implemented by the coding agent in `find_best_action` of `OpenLoopMCTS` is as follows:

```python
def find_best_action(self, hashable_state):
    cp = self.configs.cp
    Q = self.Q[hashable_state]
    P = self.P[hashable_state]
    Nsa = self.Nsa[hashable_state]
    Ns = self.Ns[hashable_state]
    valid_actions = self.valid_moves[hashable_state]
    best_uct = -float('inf')
    best_action = None
    for a in valid_actions:
        q = Q[a]
        p = P[a]
        nsa = Nsa[a]
        uct = q + cp * p * math.sqrt(Ns) / (1 + nsa)
        if uct > best_uct:
            best_uct = uct
            best_action = a
    return (best_action, best_uct)
```

The golden implementation is:

```python
def find_best_action(self, hashable_state):
    best_uct = -float('inf')
    best_action = -1
    for a in self.valid_moves[hashable_state]:
        Ns = self.Ns[hashable_state]
        if Ns == 0:
            Ns = 1e-8
        # a variant of PUCT
        uct = self.Q[hashable_state][a] + self.configs.cpuct * self.P[hashable_state][a] * math.sqrt(Ns) / (1 + self.Nsa[hashable_state][a])
        if uct > best_uct:
            best_uct = uct
            best_action = a
    return best_action, best_uct
```

Key differences:
- The agent uses `cp` (from `self.configs.cp`), while the golden uses `cpuct` (from `self.configs.cpuct`). If these are not the same, this is a logic error.
- The agent directly uses `Ns = self.Ns[hashable_state]` without checking for zero, while the golden sets `Ns = 1e-8` if `Ns == 0` to avoid division by zero or sqrt(0).
- The agent uses `Q[a]`, `P[a]`, `Nsa[a]` (where Q, P, Nsa are dicts or arrays), while the golden uses `self.Q[hashable_state][a]`, etc. This is equivalent if the dicts are set up as in the rest of the code.
- The agent initializes `best_action = None`, the golden uses `-1`. This is a minor difference.
- The agent returns `(best_action, best_uct)`, as does the golden.

The most important issue is the missing check for `Ns == 0`, which can cause a division by zero or sqrt(0) in the UCT formula. Also, the use of `cp` vs `cpuct` could be a logic error if the config uses `cpuct` as the parameter name.

Therefore, the implementation logic is correct in terms of the PUCT formula, but there are subtle implementation errors (missing zero check, possible config param mismatch).
