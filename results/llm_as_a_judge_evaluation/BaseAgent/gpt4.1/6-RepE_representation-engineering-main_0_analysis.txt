Let's compare the agent's implementation of get_rep_directions_agent to the golden implementation.

**Golden implementation:**
```python
def get_rep_directions_agent(self, 
                             model,  
                             tokenizer,  
                             hidden_states,  
                             hidden_layers,  
                             **kwargs):
    directions = {} 
    for layer in hidden_layers:
        H_train = hidden_states[layer]
        H_train_mean = H_train.mean(axis=0, keepdims=True)
        self.H_train_means[layer] = H_train_mean
        H_train = recenter(H_train, mean=H_train_mean).cpu()
        H_train = np.vstack(H_train)
        pca_model = PCA(n_components=self.n_components, whiten=False).fit(H_train)
        directions[layer] = pca_model.components_ # shape (n_components, n_features)
        self.n_components = pca_model.n_components_
    return directions
```

**Agent implementation:**
```python
def get_rep_directions_agent(self, model, tokenizer, hidden_states, hidden_layers, **kwargs):
    directions = {}
    for layer in hidden_layers:
        H = hidden_states[layer]
        mean = np.mean(H, axis=0, keepdims=True)
        self.H_train_means[layer] = mean
        H_centered = H - mean
        pca = PCA(n_components=self.n_components)
        pca.fit(H_centered)
        directions[layer] = pca.components_[0]
    return directions
```

**Key differences and issues:**

1. **Mean calculation and storage:**
   - Golden: Uses H_train_mean = H_train.mean(axis=0, keepdims=True) and stores it in self.H_train_means[layer].
   - Agent: Uses mean = np.mean(H, axis=0, keepdims=True) and stores it in self.H_train_means[layer].
   - This is equivalent.

2. **Recentering:**
   - Golden: Uses the recenter function, which converts to torch.Tensor, moves to CUDA, subtracts mean, then moves to CPU and stacks with np.vstack.
   - Agent: Does H_centered = H - mean directly (likely both are numpy arrays).
   - The golden implementation ensures the data is a torch tensor on CUDA, then moves to CPU and stacks. The agent's version skips this, which may cause device/type mismatches.

3. **PCA input:**
   - Golden: After recentering and stacking, passes H_train (now a numpy array) to PCA.
   - Agent: Passes H_centered (numpy array) to PCA. If H is already 2D, this is fine, but if H is a list of arrays, np.vstack is needed.

4. **PCA output:**
   - Golden: Stores all components: directions[layer] = pca_model.components_ (shape: (n_components, n_features))
   - Agent: Stores only the first component: directions[layer] = pca.components_[0] (shape: (n_features,))
   - This is a significant difference. The golden code expects all components, not just the first.

5. **self.n_components update:**
   - Golden: Updates self.n_components = pca_model.n_components_ after fitting.
   - Agent: Does not update self.n_components.

6. **Return value:**
   - Golden: Returns a dict mapping layer to all PCA components (as a 2D array).
   - Agent: Returns a dict mapping layer to only the first PCA component (as a 1D array).

**Conclusion:**
- The agent's implementation does not match the golden implementation in terms of output shape and content (returns only the first component, not all).
- The agent's implementation also skips the recenter function, which may cause device/type issues.
- The agent does not update self.n_components after fitting.
- These are not just subtle errors; the logic of what is returned is different and will break downstream code expecting a 2D array of components.
