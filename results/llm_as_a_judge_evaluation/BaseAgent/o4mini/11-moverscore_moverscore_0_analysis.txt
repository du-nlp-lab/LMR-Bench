    "The agent implementation computes the distance matrix C using the mean of all reference and hypothesis embeddings, resulting in a single vector for each, and then computes the norm between these means, which is not the correct way to compute the word mover's distance between sets of word embeddings.",
    "The golden reference constructs n-gram (here, unigram) representations, applies IDF weighting, and uses the full set of (possibly filtered) word embeddings for both reference and hypothesis, then computes a full pairwise distance matrix between all these embeddings, as required by the WMD algorithm.",
    "The agent implementation's approach collapses all tokens into a single mean vector per sentence, which loses the token-level granularity required for WMD, and thus the emd call is not meaningful in this context.",
    "The agent implementation omits the normalization and concatenation of min/avg/max BERT layers, as well as the stride-trick n-gram construction and IDF scaling, all of which are present in the golden reference and are essential for correct metric computation."
