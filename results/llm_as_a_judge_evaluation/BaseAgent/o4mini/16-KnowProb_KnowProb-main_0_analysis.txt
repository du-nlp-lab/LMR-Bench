    "The agent implementation does not follow the leave-one-relation-group-out cross-validation as in the golden reference. Instead, it tries to extract activations, targets, and relation_groups in one call, which is not compatible with the golden logic.",
    "The agent's get_features_and_targets_for_dataset is called on the entire prompting_results, not separately for train and test splits per relation group, and does not use the label_encoder or the correct vertical/position logic per split.",
    "The agent's undersample_dataset is applied to activations and targets arrays, but in the golden reference, undersample_dataset is applied to the DataFrame before feature extraction, which can affect the sampling and label balance.",
    "The agent implementation may not handle the DataFrame structure and label encoding as required, leading to incorrect splits and possibly incorrect classification results."
