    "The agent implementation only returns the first principal component (pca.components_[0]) for each layer, while the specification requires returning all n_components (pca.components_) for each layer.",
    "The golden reference stores the mean as a 2D array (with keepdims=True), but the agent stores it as a 1D array, which may cause downstream shape mismatches.",
    "The agent implementation does not use the provided recenter function, which may lead to device mismatches (CPU vs CUDA) and inconsistent preprocessing compared to the golden reference.",
    "The agent implementation does not update self.n_components after fitting PCA, which is done in the golden reference and may be required for correct downstream behavior."
