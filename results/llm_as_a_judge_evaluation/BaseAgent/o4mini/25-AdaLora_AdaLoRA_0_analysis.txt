    "The agent's forward function always computes F.linear(x, self.weight, self.bias) (i.e., does not apply the T() transpose for fan_in_fan_out), whereas the golden reference applies T(self.weight) if fan_in_fan_out is set. This leads to incorrect results when fan_in_fan_out=True.",
    "The agent's forward function applies the LoRA adaptation even when merge_weights is False, but the golden reference applies it only when not self.merged (i.e., when weights are not merged), regardless of merge_weights. This can lead to double-counting or missing the adaptation in some cases.",
    "The agent's forward function always adds the LoRA adaptation if r>0 and (not self.merge_weights or not self.merged), but the golden reference only adds it if r>0 and not self.merged, which is the correct logic for merged/unmerged weights.",
    "The agent's use of F.linear(self.lora_dropout(x), lora_weight) is not equivalent to the golden reference's (self.lora_dropout(x) @ (self.lora_A * self.lora_E).T @ self.lora_B.T), as the weight shapes and multiplication order differ, potentially leading to shape mismatches or incorrect results."
