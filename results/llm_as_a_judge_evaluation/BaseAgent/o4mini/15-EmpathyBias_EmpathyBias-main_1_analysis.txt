    "The agent's implementation of get_filtered_matrix matches the golden reference in logic: it computes the mean intensity for each persona/experiencer pair, filters out excluded IDs, and standardizes the resulting matrix.",
    "The function iterates over the correct group list, applies the exclusion filter, computes the mean, and standardizes the matrix using mean and std, just as in the reference.",
    "No off-by-one, missing checks, or edge case errors are present; the implementation is faithful to the reference and the described requirements."
