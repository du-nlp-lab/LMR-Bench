    "The agent implementation computes the mean cosine similarity between pairs of original and decrypted feature levels using real embeddings from a sentence transformer, which is a correct and even more realistic approach than the golden reference's mock embeddings.",
    "It iterates over all pairs, encodes both strings, computes cosine similarity, accumulates the score, and averages at the end, matching the intended logic.",
    "It saves both the enc_dec_pairs and the results to pickle files, as in the golden reference (though the golden reference has these lines commented out, the intent is clear).",
    "Edge cases (e.g., empty input) are handled by returning 0.0 if enc_dec_pairs is empty, and the function prints and returns the mean as expected."
