    "The agent implementation of generate_counter_parametric_knowledge_dataset does not match the logic of the golden reference: it applies build_counter_parametric_knowledge to each row, passing only the row, nb_counter_parametric_knowledge, and objects_to_first_token_id, whereas the golden reference passes each field as a named argument and also passes a filtered DataFrame for parametric_knowledge_rel.",
    "The agent's get_objects_to_first_token_id_dict is called with a list of unique parametric objects, while the golden reference calls it with the full parametric_knowledge DataFrame, which may affect the mapping and downstream logic.",
    "The agent's build_counter_parametric_knowledge call signature is inconsistent with the expected arguments in the golden reference, which could lead to missing or incorrect fields in the resulting DataFrame.",
    "The agent's approach will not produce the same output structure or semantics as the golden reference, leading to incorrect results."
