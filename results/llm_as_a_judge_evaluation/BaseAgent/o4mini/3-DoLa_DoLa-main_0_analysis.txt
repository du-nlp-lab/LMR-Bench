    "The main logic for DoLA greedy decoding, including the dynamic selection of premature layers via JS divergence, is implemented correctly and matches the golden reference.",
    "However, the calculation of KL and JS divergence in the agent code uses manual log/softmax and sum, rather than torch.nn.functional.kl_div with reduction='none' and mean(-1) as in the golden. This could lead to subtle numerical differences, especially for non-standard distributions or edge cases.",
    "The mask threshold for filtering logits is -1000.0 in the agent, while the golden uses -1e3. This is a negligible difference, but technically not identical.",
    "Other aspects such as input/output handling, stopping criteria, and premature_layer_dist tracking are correct and faithful to the reference."
