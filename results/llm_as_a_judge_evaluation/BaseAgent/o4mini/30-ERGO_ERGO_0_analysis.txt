    "The agent's focal_loss implementation matches the golden reference in logic: it computes per-sample log-softmax, gathers the correct class probabilities, applies the alpha weighting, and the focal modulation (1-pt)^gamma.",
    "The handling of self.size_average for mean vs sum is correct and matches the reference.",
    "Device placement for alpha is handled, and the code is robust to both scalar and list alpha inputs.",
    "No edge cases or subtle errors are present; the implementation is faithful to the paper and the reference."
