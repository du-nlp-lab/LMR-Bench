    "The agent's implementation saves the 'inputs' dictionary with an extra 'img_path' key, which is not present in the golden reference. The golden reference only saves 'layer_id', 'model_family', 'model_size', and 'savedir'.",
    "The agent saves the feature activations as a torch tensor (feat_abs.cpu()) instead of converting it to a numpy array (feat_abs.cpu().numpy()) as in the golden reference, which may affect downstream compatibility.",
    "The index passed to lib.plot_3d_feat_vit is 'idx' (0-based) in the agent, while the golden reference uses 'layer_id - 1' (also 0-based), so this is correct.",
    "Otherwise, the main logic of extracting, visualizing, and saving the features is correct and matches the intent of the specification."
