    "The main logic of counting, for each (i, j) pair, the number of examples in group i whose subject or object appears in group j, is implemented correctly using isin and sum.",
    "However, the agent implementation sets the diagonal (i==j) to 0, whereas the golden reference computes the actual overlap (which may be nonzero if there are duplicate subjects/objects within a group). This is a subtle but important difference, as the diagonal should reflect actual overlap, not be forcibly zeroed.",
    "The agent implementation also uses sets for subjects/objects in group j, which is fine, but the main subtlety is the diagonal handling."
