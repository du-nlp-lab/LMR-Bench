    "The core PUCT formula and logic in find_best_action matches the golden reference: it computes UCT as Q + cpuct * P * sqrt(Ns) / (1 + Nsa), iterating over valid actions and selecting the best.",
    "However, the agent implementation introduces a subtle difference in how cpuct is retrieved: it tries to get 'c_puct' from configs, falling back to 'cpuct', while the golden reference always uses 'cpuct'. This could lead to inconsistent behavior if the config uses a different attribute name.",
    "The agent implementation initializes best_action to None instead of -1, which is a minor difference but could cause issues if the valid_moves list is empty (though this is unlikely in practice).",
    "Overall, the main logic is correct, but these subtle differences could cause edge-case bugs or inconsistencies."
