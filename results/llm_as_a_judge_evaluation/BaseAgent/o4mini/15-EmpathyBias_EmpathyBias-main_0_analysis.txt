    "The get_delta function in both the golden reference and the agent implementation computes the difference between the mean of in-group and out-group matrix values, using the same logic for group membership (check_in_group).",
    "The function iterates over all matrix cells, correctly classifies them as in-group or out-group, and computes the means accordingly.",
    "There are no off-by-one errors, missing checks, or deviations in the logic or edge case handling for this function.",
    "The implementation is faithful to the specification and matches the golden reference exactly in intent and effect."
