    "The agent implementation performs probing separately on rp_log_data_list and rp_question_data_list, training and evaluating classifiers on each set independently, rather than concatenating both sets and their labels for a binary classification task as in the golden reference.",
    "The golden reference correctly merges both data sources and labels, then splits into train/test and evaluates the classifier's ability to distinguish between the two classes, which is the intended probing task. The agent's approach does not test the model's ability to distinguish between the two data types, but rather just fits to each label set in isolation.",
    "This fundamental deviation means the agent's function does not fulfill the probing evaluation as described in the specification and the golden reference."
