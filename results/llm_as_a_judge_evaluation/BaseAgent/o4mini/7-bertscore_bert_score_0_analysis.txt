    "The agent implementation does not normalize the embeddings before computing cosine similarity, which is essential for cosine similarity to be meaningful. The golden reference normalizes embeddings along the last dimension.",
    "The agent implementation computes the similarity matrix as torch.matmul(ref_embedding, hyp_embedding.transpose(-2, -1)), which is the reverse of the golden reference (which uses torch.bmm(hyp_embedding, ref_embedding.transpose(1, 2))). This leads to swapped axes and incorrect max operations for precision and recall.",
    "The agent implementation does not apply attention masks to the similarity matrix, so padding tokens may be included in the max operations, leading to incorrect scores.",
    "The agent implementation does not normalize the idf weights (i.e., dividing by their sum per sentence), which the golden reference does, so the weighting is inconsistent and can bias the score."
