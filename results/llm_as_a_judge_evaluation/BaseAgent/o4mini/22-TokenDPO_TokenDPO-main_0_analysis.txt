    "The agent implementation of tdpo_loss returns (losses, chosen_logps_margin, rejected_logps_margin), but the golden reference returns (losses, chosen_rewards, rejected_rewards), where chosen_rewards and rejected_rewards are computed as beta * (chosen_logps_margin + chosen_position_kl).",
    "The agent implementation does not compute or return the rewards as required by the specification and the golden reference, which will break downstream code expecting these values for metrics and reward accuracy.",
    "The agent implementation does not detach the appropriate tensors for the reward computation, as is done in the golden reference (chosen_rewards = beta * chosen_values.detach()), which is important for correct gradient flow and logging.",
    "The loss computation logic is otherwise similar, but the outputs are not as specified, which is a core deviation."
