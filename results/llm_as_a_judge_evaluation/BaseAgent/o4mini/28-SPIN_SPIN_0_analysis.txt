    "The agent implementation computes the margin as `real_rewards - generated_rewards` and then applies `F.softplus(-margin)` for the 'sigmoid' loss, which is not equivalent to the correct SPIN loss formula `-logsigmoid(beta * (pi_logratios - ref_logratios))`.",
    "The agent's handling of the `reference_free` flag is incorrect: it sets the reference logprobs to zero, which changes the reward calculation, but the correct approach is to set the reference log-ratio to zero in the loss computation only, not in the reward calculation.",
    "The agent's loss does not match the SPIN paper or the golden reference: the golden reference computes the loss as `-F.logsigmoid(self.beta * logits)` where `logits = (policy_real_logps - policy_generated_logps) - (opponent_real_logps - opponent_generated_logps)`, while the agent uses a margin of rewards, which is not the same.",
    "The reward calculation in the agent is not detached from the computation graph as in the golden reference, which may lead to incorrect gradients."
