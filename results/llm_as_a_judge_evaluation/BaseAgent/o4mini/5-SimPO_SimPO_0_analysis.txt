    "The agent implementation of simpo_loss uses a different formula for the loss than the golden reference: it computes losses as F.relu(rejected_rewards + gamma - chosen_rewards) for 'hinge' and as -F.logsigmoid(chosen_rewards - rejected_rewards - gamma) for the default, whereas the golden reference computes losses as -F.logsigmoid(self.beta * logits) * (1 - self.label_smoothing) - F.logsigmoid(-self.beta * logits) * self.label_smoothing for 'sigmoid' and torch.relu(1 - self.beta * logits) for 'hinge', with logits = (policy_chosen_logps - policy_rejected_logps) - self.gamma_beta_ratio.",
    "The agent's use of gamma = self.beta * self.gamma_beta_ratio is inconsistent with the golden reference, which uses gamma_beta_ratio directly as a shift in the logit space before multiplying by beta.",
    "The agent implementation does not handle label_smoothing for the 'sigmoid' loss type, whereas the golden reference does.",
    "These differences mean the agent's simpo_loss will produce different (and incorrect) loss values compared to the specification in the paper and the golden reference."
