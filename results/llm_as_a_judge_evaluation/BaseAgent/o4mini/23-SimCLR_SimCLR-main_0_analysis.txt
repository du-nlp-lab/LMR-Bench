    "The agent implementation's info_nce_loss constructs logits by removing the diagonal and then attempts to place the positive at index 0 via a permutation, but this is not equivalent to the golden reference's approach, which uses a mask and label matrix to select all positives and negatives correctly.",
    "The agent's method assumes exactly two views (N even, batch_size = N//2), and for each i, the positive is at j = i + batch_size or i - batch_size, but this does not generalize to n_views > 2, nor does it handle the case where multiple positives exist (as in the golden reference).",
    "The agent's logits shape is (N, N-1), but the positive is not always at index 0 unless the permutation is correct, and the permutation logic is flawed (it does not guarantee the positive is at index 0 for all i).",
    "The golden reference uses a label matrix to select all positives and negatives, ensuring the correct construction of logits and labels for arbitrary n_views, while the agent's code is hardcoded for two views and does not generalize."
