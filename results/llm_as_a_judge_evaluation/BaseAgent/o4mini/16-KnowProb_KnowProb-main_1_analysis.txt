    "The core logic of removing rows where the subject and parametric object are similar (using Jaro-Winkler similarity and substring checks) is implemented correctly.",
    "However, the agent's implementation resets the index of the returned DataFrame, which is not present in the golden reference. This can affect downstream code that relies on the original indices.",
    "The agent's implementation also adds extra checks for missing or non-string values (returns True to keep such rows), which is not present in the golden reference. This is a subtle difference in edge case handling.",
    "The golden reference uses a boolean mask to filter out rows with overlap, while the agent uses a keep_row function and inverts the logic, but the effect is the same except for the index reset and extra type checks."
