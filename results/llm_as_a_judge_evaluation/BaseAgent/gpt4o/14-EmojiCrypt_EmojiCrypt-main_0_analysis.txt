    "The agent implementation matches the logic of the golden reference: it iterates over enc_dec_pairs, extracts the original and decrypted values, generates mock embeddings, computes cosine similarity, accumulates the score, and averages over the number of pairs.",
    "It saves the results to a pickle file as in the golden reference, and prints/returns the mean cosine similarity.",
    "There are no off-by-one errors, missing checks, or deviations from the intended logic for this mock evaluation function."
