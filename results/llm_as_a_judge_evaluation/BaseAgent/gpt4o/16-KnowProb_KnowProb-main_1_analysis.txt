    "The implementation of remove_object_subject_overlap in src/data.py matches the logic in the golden reference: it applies detect_subject_object_overlap row-wise and filters out rows where subject and parametric_object are similar above the threshold.",
    "The detect_subject_object_overlap function is also implemented identically in both files, using lowercased substring checks and Jaro-Winkler similarity.",
    "No edge cases or error conditions are missed; the function is robust to the expected input types and behavior.",
    "There are no off-by-one errors, missing checks, or subtle deviations in the implementation."
