    "The agent implementation expects rp_log_data_list and rp_question_data_list to be lists of lists (with each element containing all layers for a sample), and then extracts the i-th layer for all samples, whereas the golden reference expects rp_log_data_list and rp_question_data_list to be lists where each element is the data for a specific layer (i.e., already split by layer).",
    "This mismatch in data structure means the agent's code will not work correctly if the input is structured as in the golden reference, leading to incorrect feature matrices and thus invalid probing results.",
    "Additionally, the agent uses a test_size of 0.2, while the golden reference uses 0.4, which changes the evaluation split and could affect results.",
    "The agent omits the 'average' parameter in f1_score (should be 'binary'), which could cause errors or warnings if the data is not strictly binary or if the default changes."
