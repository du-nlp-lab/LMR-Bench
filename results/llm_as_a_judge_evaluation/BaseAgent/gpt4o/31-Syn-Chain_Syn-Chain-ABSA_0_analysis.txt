    "The agent's implementation produces the correct CoNLL-U fields and values for each token, matching the logic of the golden reference.",
    "However, the agent omits the header row present in the golden reference, which may be expected for clarity or downstream processing.",
    "The agent uses tab-separated values (standard for CoNLL-U), while the golden reference uses a fixed-width, space-padded format; this is a minor formatting difference but could affect strict output matching.",
    "Both implementations handle token indices and head indices correctly (off-by-one adjustment), and there are no off-by-one or logic errors in the core algorithm."
