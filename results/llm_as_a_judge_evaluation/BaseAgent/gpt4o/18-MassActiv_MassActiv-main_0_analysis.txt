    "The core logic of extracting the feature activations, visualizing them, and saving both the input parameters and activations as pickle files is correct and matches the specification.",
    "However, the agent's implementation omits the 'savedir' key from the input_params dictionary when saving 'run_exp1_inputs_layer_{layer_id + 1}.pkl', whereas the golden reference includes it. This could affect reproducibility or downstream analysis expecting this field.",
    "All other steps, including the off-by-one handling for layer_id, image loading, transformation, and file naming, are correct and consistent with the specification."
