    "The agent implementation does not perform autoregressive token generation; instead, it computes adjusted logits for the entire sequence at once and returns the argmax, rather than generating tokens step by step as in the golden reference.",
    "The golden reference generates tokens one at a time, updating the input with each new token and stopping at the EOS token, while the agent implementation does not do this and instead outputs a fixed-length sequence.",
    "The agent implementation applies log_softmax to logits before combining them, which is not what the golden reference does (it combines raw logits, then applies softmax). This changes the meaning of the adjustment and the resulting probabilities.",
    "The agent implementation ignores the temperature parameter in the softmax division, which is crucial for controlling the sharpness of the distribution and is used in the golden reference."
