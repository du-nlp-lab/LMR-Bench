    "The agent implementation of preference_loss does not handle the reference_free and label_smoothing parameters, which are required by the specification (even if label_smoothing is to be ignored, reference_free is not).",
    "The agent implementation always computes losses as -F.logsigmoid(beta * (policy_log_ratios - reference_log_ratios)), which is only correct for the default DPO loss with label_smoothing=0 and reference_free=False. It does not implement the logic for IPO loss (ipo=True) or reference_free=True, nor does it handle label_smoothing > 0.",
    "The golden reference includes logic for IPO loss, reference_free, and label_smoothing, and the agent implementation omits all of these, leading to incorrect results in those cases.",
    "Thus, the core algorithm deviates from the specification and will produce wrong results for any configuration except the default DPO loss with label_smoothing=0 and reference_free=False."
