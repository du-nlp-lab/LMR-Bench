    "The find_best_action function in the agent implementation is missing the core logic: it does not compute or return best_action and best_uct, but simply returns undefined variables.",
    "The golden reference implements the PUCT formula loop, iterating over valid actions, computing UCT for each, and selecting the best, which is entirely absent in the agent's code.",
    "This omission means the function will raise a NameError at runtime and cannot select actions, fundamentally breaking the MCTS algorithm."
