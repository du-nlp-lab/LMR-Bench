    "The agent implementation leaves the core logic of the forward methods in all three classes (HierarchyTransformerLoss, HyperbolicClusteringLoss, HyperbolicCentripetalLoss) as unimplemented (with 'pass' or placeholders), whereas the golden reference provides the full correct logic.",
    "No actual computation of the hyperbolic clustering loss, centripetal loss, or their combination is performed in the agent's code, so it cannot produce correct results.",
    "Critical steps such as distance calculations, margin application, and mean reduction are missing, which are essential for the loss computation as specified in the paper and the golden reference."
