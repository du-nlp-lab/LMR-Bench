    "The agent implementation does not use the required build_counter_parametric_knowledge function, which is central to the logic in the golden reference. Instead, it manually constructs counterfactuals by shuffling and sampling objects, which is not equivalent.",
    "The agent implementation does not use get_objects_to_first_token_id_dict to build the all_dataset_objects_to_their_first_token_id mapping, nor does it pass the correct parametric_knowledge_rel DataFrame for each row, both of which are required by the golden reference and likely necessary for correct downstream processing.",
    "The agent implementation simply replaces the statement_object in the statement string, which may lead to incorrect replacements if the object appears multiple times or as a substring, whereas the golden reference delegates this logic to build_counter_parametric_knowledge, which may handle such cases more robustly.",
    "The agent implementation repeats the function definition three times, which is redundant and could cause confusion or errors in actual use."
