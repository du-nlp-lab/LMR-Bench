    "The JS divergence calculation in the agent implementation is incorrect: it averages the premature_probs across layers (M = premature_probs.mean(dim=0)), instead of using the correct M = 0.5 * (softmax_mature_layer[None, :, :] + softmax_premature_layers) as in the golden reference.",
    "The agent implementation computes log_mature = mature_probs.log() and log_premature = premature_probs.log(), then computes kl_divs = F.kl_div(log_mature, M, ...) + F.kl_div(log_premature, M, ...), which is not the correct way to compute JS divergence between distributions. The golden reference uses F.kl_div on log_softmax distributions and averages as per the JS formula.",
    "The agent implementation does not apply the relative_top filtering and masking logic in the candidate_premature_layers branch, which is present in the golden reference and is important for correct output.",
    "These errors will result in the wrong premature layer being selected and incorrect logits, leading to wrong generation results."
