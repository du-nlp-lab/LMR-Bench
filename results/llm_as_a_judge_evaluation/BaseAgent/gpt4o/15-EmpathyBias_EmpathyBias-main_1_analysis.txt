    "The core logic of get_filtered_matrix matches the golden reference: it computes a matrix of mean intensities (excluding specified IDs), then standardizes the matrix (subtract mean, divide by std).",
    "However, the agent implementation omits rounding the mean values to two decimal places before standardization, as done in the golden reference (which uses round(sum(...)/len(...), 2)). This can lead to subtle differences in the resulting standardized matrix due to floating point precision.",
    "The agent implementation includes a redundant duplicate definition of get_filtered_matrix, which is unnecessary and could cause confusion or maintenance issues.",
    "The agent implementation does not print summary statistics (mean, std, min/max) as in the golden reference, but this is not a logic errorâ€”just a difference in verbosity."
