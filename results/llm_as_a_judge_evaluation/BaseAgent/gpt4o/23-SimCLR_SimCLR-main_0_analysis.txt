    "The agent's implementation of info_nce_loss is completely missing; it only contains the function signature and docstring, with an immediate return of undefined variables logits and labels.",
    "No logic is present to compute the similarity matrix, mask out the diagonal, select positives/negatives, or normalize/logits as required by the InfoNCE loss.",
    "As a result, the function will raise a NameError at runtime and does not fulfill any part of the required algorithm."
