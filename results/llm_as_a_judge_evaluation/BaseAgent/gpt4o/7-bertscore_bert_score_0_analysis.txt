    "The agent implementation does not normalize the embeddings before computing cosine similarity, which is essential for cosine similarity calculation and is explicitly done in the golden reference.",
    "The agent uses torch.einsum with a 4D tensor, which is inconsistent with the expected 3D batch matrix multiplication (bmm) in the golden reference, and the dimensions do not match the described input shapes (BxKxd).",
    "The masking logic in the agent is not equivalent to the golden reference: the golden code constructs a mask via bmm and applies it to the similarity matrix, while the agent uses masked_fill with boolean masks, which may not align with the actual valid token positions.",
    "The agent's F1 and final aggregation logic diverges from the golden reference, which uses idf-weighted sums for both precision and recall, while the agent appears to average F1 scores weighted by ref_idf only, missing the correct idf weighting and normalization steps."
