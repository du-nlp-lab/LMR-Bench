    "The agent's tdpo_loss implementation does not compute the rewards and losses as specified in the golden reference and the paper.",
    "In the agent code, 'rewards' is computed as chosen_logps_margin - rejected_logps_margin, but the correct reward for each response should be (chosen_logps_margin + chosen_position_kl) and (rejected_logps_margin + rejected_position_kl), as in the golden reference.",
    "The agent's 'values' variable is not equivalent to the 'logits' in the golden reference, as it omits the position KL terms and their correct scaling/detachment.",
    "The function returns (losses, chosen_logps_margin, rejected_logps_margin) instead of (losses, chosen_rewards, rejected_rewards), which is not faithful to the intended reward structure and will break downstream reward-based metrics."
