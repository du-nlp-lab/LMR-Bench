    "The agent implementation of spin_loss computes rewards_real = policy_real_logps - opponent_real_logps (or 0 if reference_free), and rewards_generated similarly, then uses F.softplus(rewards_real - rewards_generated) as the loss for 'sigmoid' loss_type.",
    "According to the SPIN paper and the golden reference, the correct loss is -log(sigmoid(beta * (policy_real_logps - policy_generated_logps - (opponent_real_logps - opponent_generated_logps)))), i.e., -F.logsigmoid(beta * (pi_logratios - ref_logratios)). The agent's use of F.softplus is not equivalent and omits the beta scaling, leading to incorrect optimization dynamics.",
    "The agent's loss does not match the mathematical form in the paper or the golden reference, and the reward scaling by beta is missing in the returned rewards, which should be beta * (policy_logps - opponent_logps).",
    "Therefore, the core algorithm deviates from the specification and will produce wrong results."
