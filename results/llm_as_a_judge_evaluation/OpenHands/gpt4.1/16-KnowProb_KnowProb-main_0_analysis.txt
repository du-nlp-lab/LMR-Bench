    "The agent implementation does not use the provided get_features_and_targets_for_dataset and undersample_dataset functions, which are essential for correct feature extraction, label encoding, and class balancing as per the golden reference and likely the paper's methodology.",
    "The agent implementation assumes the presence of module-specific activation columns (e.g., 'mlp_activations') and directly manipulates numpy arrays, which is not compatible with the golden reference's approach of extracting features and targets via helper functions that handle vertical and non-vertical cases, label encoding, and module selection.",
    "The agent implementation does not encode labels using the required label_encoder mapping (e.g., {'CK': 0, 'PK': 1}), which can lead to incorrect target values for classification.",
    "The agent implementation does not perform undersampling of the datasets before training/testing, which is a critical step in the golden reference to ensure balanced classes and fair evaluation."
