    "The agent implementation saves the feature activations as a torch tensor (feat_abs) directly to pickle, whereas the golden reference saves feat_abs.cpu().numpy(), which is more portable and less error-prone for downstream analysis.",
    "The agent implementation includes extra logic for handling hooks and custom blocks, but the golden reference always uses mp.enable_vit_custom_block and expects the .feat attribute to be present after the forward pass. This could lead to subtle differences if the model/layer does not have .feat or if the monkey patch is not applied as expected.",
    "The input dictionary saved by the agent includes 'img_path', while the golden reference does not; conversely, the golden reference includes 'savedir' in the input dict, which the agent omits. This could affect reproducibility or downstream scripts expecting a specific set of keys.",
    "The agent uses 'layer_idx' (0-based) for visualization, while the golden reference uses 'layer_id - 1', which is equivalent, but the naming could cause confusion if not handled consistently elsewhere."
