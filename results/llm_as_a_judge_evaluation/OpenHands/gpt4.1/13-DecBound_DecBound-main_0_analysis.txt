    "The agent's generate_tasks function is missing the core logic: it does not generate any data or call generate_x_y in a loop, nor does it initialize or fill X_data and Y_data.",
    "The function simply returns X_data and Y_data, which are undefined, resulting in a NameError and no actual task generation.",
    "This is a fundamental deviation from the specification, which requires generating and aggregating datasets for each task."
