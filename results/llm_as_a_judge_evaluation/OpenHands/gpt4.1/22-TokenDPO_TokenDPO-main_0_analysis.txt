    "The agent implementation does not compute the TDPO loss as specified in the golden reference: it omits the addition of the position KL terms to the rewards, which are essential for the correct reward calculation.",
    "The agent's 'values' variable (used for the logits in logsigmoid) is computed as chosen_rewards - rejected_rewards - (rejected_kl - chosen_kl) or with alpha scaling, but the correct formula is (chosen_logps_margin - rejected_logps_margin) - alpha * (rejected_position_kl - chosen_position_kl.detach()), matching the golden reference.",
    "The agent's rewards are just the logps margins, not the sum of logps margin and position KL as in the reference, and the rewards are not scaled by beta as required.",
    "The agent's implementation will produce numerically and semantically different results from the golden reference and the paper, leading to incorrect training dynamics."
