    "The core DoLa algorithm for selecting the premature layer is implemented incorrectly: the golden reference computes the JS divergence between each candidate premature layer and the mature layer (using the average distribution M for each candidate), and selects the candidate with the maximum JS divergence. The agent code instead averages the premature probabilities across all candidates to form M, then computes a single JS divergence per batch, not per candidate, and selects the max over batch, not over candidates.",
    "The agent's code for the DoLa selection does not match the golden reference's per-candidate JS divergence calculation, leading to incorrect selection of the premature layer and thus incorrect logits for generation.",
    "There is also a debug print and sys.exit(1) in the agent code, which would prevent the function from running to completion, but the main issue is the incorrect DoLa logic."
