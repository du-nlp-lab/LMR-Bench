    "The agent's forward function computes the adaptation as F.linear(x_, adaptation, None), where adaptation = lora_B @ (lora_A * lora_E), but this is not equivalent to the golden reference's (lora_dropout(x) @ (lora_A * lora_E).T @ lora_B.T).",
    "The golden reference applies the adaptation as: result += (lora_dropout(x) @ (lora_A * lora_E).T @ lora_B.T) * scaling / (ranknum+1e-5), which is mathematically different from the agent's approach, especially in the order of matrix multiplications and transpositions.",
    "The agent's code also applies lora_dropout as a module (self.lora_dropout > 0.0), but in the golden reference, lora_dropout is always called as a function, which may be a nn.Dropout module, not a float.",
    "The agent's forward does not check for the merged state (self.merged), so it may apply the adaptation even when weights are merged, unlike the golden reference which only applies the adaptation when not merged."
