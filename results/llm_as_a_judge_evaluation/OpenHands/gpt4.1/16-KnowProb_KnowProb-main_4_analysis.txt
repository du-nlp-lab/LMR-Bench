    "The agent implementation does not use the required build_counter_parametric_knowledge function to generate counter-parametric knowledge, instead it simply selects other objects from the same relation group and constructs new rows, which is not faithful to the intended logic.",
    "The golden reference calls build_counter_parametric_knowledge for each parametric knowledge record, passing in a variety of fields and the relevant subset of the dataframe, ensuring that the counterfactuals are constructed with the correct context and structure.",
    "The agent's implementation omits several required fields (e.g., all_dataset_objects_to_their_first_token_id, parametric_knowledge_rel) and does not ensure the correct structure or semantics of the counterfactuals, leading to potentially incorrect or incomplete results."
