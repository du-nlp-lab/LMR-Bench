    "The agent's implementation of info_nce_loss matches the golden reference line-for-line in all essential logic, including label construction, feature normalization, similarity computation, masking, positive/negative selection, logits/labels construction, and temperature scaling.",
    "There are no missing checks, off-by-one errors, or subtle mistakes; all tensor shapes and device placements are handled identically.",
    "Any commented-out debug code in the golden reference is non-essential and does not affect correctness.",
    "The function's output and behavior are fully faithful to the specification and the reference."
