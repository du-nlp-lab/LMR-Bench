    "The agent implementation in core/mcts.py uses a different variable for the PUCT exploration constant: it checks for 'c_puct' in configs (with a default of 1.0), while the golden reference uses 'cpuct'. This can lead to the wrong constant being used, affecting the search behavior.",
    "The agent implementation computes N_sum as the sum of Nsa[hashable_state][a] over valid actions, whereas the golden reference (and standard PUCT) uses Ns[hashable_state] (the total number of visits to the state). This can result in sqrt(0) and division by zero for unvisited nodes, and is a deviation from the correct PUCT formula.",
    "The agent implementation sets best_action = None initially, while the golden reference uses -1. This is minor, but the main issue is the incorrect calculation of the exploration term, which will produce wrong action selection and thus incorrect MCTS behavior."
