    "The agent's focal_loss implementation computes the adaptive focal loss identically to the golden reference, using log_softmax, gathering the correct class probabilities, applying the alpha weighting, and the (1-p_t)^gamma modulation.",
    "The handling of size_average (mean vs sum) is correct and matches the golden reference, and the device placement for alpha is properly managed.",
    "No edge cases or error conditions are mishandled; the logic is robust and faithful to the paper and reference code."
