    "The agent implementation omits the crucial step of aggregating BERT embeddings across the last 5 layers using min, mean, and max, and concatenating them, as done in the golden reference. Instead, it simply averages across all layers or uses the embeddings as-is, which changes the representation and thus the computed distances.",
    "The agent implementation computes the distance matrix only between reference and hypothesis tokens, while the golden reference concatenates both sets of embeddings and computes a full pairwise distance matrix, which is required for the correct application of the Word Mover's Distance.",
    "The agent implementation normalizes idf weights for each sentence, but the golden reference constructs a combined weight vector (c1 and c2) for the concatenated embeddings, which is necessary for the correct EMD computation.",
    "These deviations result in a fundamentally different and incorrect computation of the Word Mover's Score compared to the specification and the golden reference."
