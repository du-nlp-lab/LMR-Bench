    "The agent implementation of spin_loss uses losses = torch.log1p(torch.exp(-t)), where t = real_rewards - generated_rewards, which is not the correct SPIN loss as described in the paper or the golden reference.",
    "The correct SPIN loss (as in the golden reference) is -log(sigmoid(beta * (pi_logratios - ref_logratios))), where pi_logratios = policy_real_logps - policy_generated_logps and ref_logratios = opponent_real_logps - opponent_generated_logps. The agent's implementation does not compute these log-ratios and does not use the correct loss formula.",
    "The agent implementation also incorrectly computes real_rewards and generated_rewards as beta * (policy_logps - opponent_logps) without detaching, whereas the golden reference detaches these values to prevent gradients from flowing through the rewards.",
    "The agent implementation does not handle the loss_type ('sigmoid' or 'hinge') as in the golden reference, and always uses the log1p(exp(-t)) form, which is not equivalent to the required loss."
