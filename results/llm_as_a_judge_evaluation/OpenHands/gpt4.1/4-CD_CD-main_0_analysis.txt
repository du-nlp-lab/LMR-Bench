    "The agent implementation uses a test_size of 0.3 and stratifies the split, while the reference uses test_size=0.4 and does not stratify. This can affect the evaluation metrics and is a subtle deviation.",
    "The agent uses f1_score with average='weighted', while the reference uses average='binary'. For binary classification, 'binary' is more appropriate and matches the reference intent.",
    "The agent sets max_iter=1000 for LogisticRegression, which is a safe improvement but not a deviation.",
    "The agent checks for binary classification before computing ROC AUC, which is a reasonable safeguard, but the reference assumes binary classification."
