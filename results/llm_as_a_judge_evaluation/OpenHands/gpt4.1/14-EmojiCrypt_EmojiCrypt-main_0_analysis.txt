    "The agent implementation correctly computes the mean cosine similarity between the original and decrypted feature levels using real embeddings from a sentence transformer, as per the intended design in the paper and repository.",
    "It iterates over all pairs, encodes both strings, computes cosine similarity, accumulates the results, and averages them, matching the described and commented-out reference logic.",
    "The function saves the results to a pickle file as expected and handles the case of zero pairs gracefully.",
    "No off-by-one, missing checks, or logical errors are present; the implementation is robust and faithful to the specification."
