    "The agent implementation of remove_object_subject_overlap only checks the Jaro-Winkler similarity and does not check for substring containment (i.e., whether the subject is in the object or vice versa, case-insensitive), which is required by the specification and present in the golden reference.",
    "The golden reference uses a helper (detect_subject_object_overlap) that returns True if either substring containment or similarity threshold is met, and then removes those rows. The agent implementation only removes rows based on the similarity threshold, missing the substring containment check, leading to incorrect filtering.",
    "This omission means that some rows where the subject and object are substrings of each other (but not similar enough by Jaro-Winkler) will not be removed, violating the intended logic."
