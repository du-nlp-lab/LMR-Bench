    "The core logic of extracting token attributes and mapping them to CoNLL-U columns is correct and matches the golden reference.",
    "The agent implementation uses a different (less precise) column alignment: it joins fields with four spaces instead of using fixed-width formatting, which can lead to misaligned columns in the output.",
    "The agent adds a conditional for HEAD to avoid self-referential heads (token.head == token), but in spaCy, the root token's head is itself, and both implementations ultimately assign the same value (i+1), so this is not a logic error but a redundant check.",
    "No handling of edge cases or errors is present in either implementation, but this is not required by the specification."
