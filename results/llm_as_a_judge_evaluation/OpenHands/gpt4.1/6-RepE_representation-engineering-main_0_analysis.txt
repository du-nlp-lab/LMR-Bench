    "The core PCA logic and recentering are implemented correctly and match the golden reference.",
    "However, the agent implementation omits updating self.n_components with pca_model.n_components_ inside the loop, which is present in the golden reference. This could lead to subtle issues if self.n_components is expected to reflect the fitted PCA's n_components after fitting.",
    "The agent implementation uses .numpy() or np.array() to convert the centered tensor to a numpy array, which is fine, but the golden reference uses np.vstack(H_train), which is more robust if H_train is a list of arrays/tensors. This could cause subtle issues if the input format changes.",
    "Otherwise, the main logic and output structure are correct."
