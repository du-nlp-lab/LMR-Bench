    "The agent implementation of simpo_loss always uses the formula: losses = -log(sigmoid(reward_diff - margin)), which corresponds to the sigmoid loss with no label smoothing and no support for hinge loss.",
    "The golden reference supports both 'sigmoid' and 'hinge' loss types, and also incorporates label smoothing for the sigmoid case, as described in the SimPO paper.",
    "The agent implementation ignores the self.loss_type and self.label_smoothing parameters, so it will not behave correctly for hinge loss or for sigmoid loss with label smoothing.",
    "Therefore, the core algorithm deviates from the specification and will produce wrong results for many valid configurations."
