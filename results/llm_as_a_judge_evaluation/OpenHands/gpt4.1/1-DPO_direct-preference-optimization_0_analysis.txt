    "The agent implementation computes the DPO loss as -F.logsigmoid(logits), where logits = chosen_rewards - rejected_rewards, but this is not the correct DPO loss as per the paper and the golden reference.",
    "The correct DPO loss (with label_smoothing=0) is -F.logsigmoid(beta * logits), where logits = (policy_chosen_logps - policy_rejected_logps) - (reference_chosen_logps - reference_rejected_logps), and rewards are computed as beta * (policy_logps - reference_logps). The agent implementation instead applies beta before the subtraction, which is not equivalent.",
    "The agent implementation also does not handle the 'ipo' and 'label_smoothing' arguments, which are ignored as per the instructions, but it also incorrectly handles 'reference_free' by zeroing out both reference_chosen_logps and reference_rejected_logps, rather than setting ref_logratios to zero as in the golden reference.",
    "Overall, the loss calculation in the agent is not faithful to the DPO loss as described in the paper and the golden reference, leading to incorrect optimization behavior."
