    "The agent implementation of get_filtered_matrix includes 'a person' in both axes of the matrix (full_group_list), while the golden reference only uses group_list (excluding 'a person').",
    "The agent implementation returns a (n+1)x(n+1) matrix (including 'a person'), whereas the golden reference returns an n x n matrix (only the specified group members).",
    "The agent implementation does not round the mean values to two decimals before standardization, while the golden reference does (though this is less critical).",
    "This difference in matrix shape and indexing will cause downstream errors and misalignment with the intended analysis, especially for functions that expect the matrix to only cover the group_list."
