    "The get_sentence function in both the golden reference and the agent implementation is identical and matches the specification: it constructs the input string k according to the prompting method.",
    "All required prompting strategies ('zero_shot', 'zero_shot_cot', 'few_shot', 'few_shot_cot', 'auto_cot') are handled correctly, with appropriate triggers and demo concatenation.",
    "There are no missing edge cases or off-by-one errors; error handling for unknown methods is present.",
    "The function is faithful to the paper and repository logic, with no extraneous or missing logic."
