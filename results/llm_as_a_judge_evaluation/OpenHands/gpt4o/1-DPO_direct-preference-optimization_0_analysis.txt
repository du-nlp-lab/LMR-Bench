    "The agent implementation of preference_loss does not follow the DPO loss formula as described in the paper or the golden reference. It uses a binary cross-entropy with logits and an importance weight, which is not the DPO loss.",
    "The correct DPO loss involves computing logits as the difference between policy and reference log-ratios, then applying a logsigmoid (or its negative) with a beta scaling, as in the golden reference. The agent code ignores the reference model's log-probabilities in the loss calculation and does not handle the beta parameter or reference_free logic correctly.",
    "The rewards in the agent code are not scaled by beta and are not detached, which is inconsistent with the golden reference and the DPO paper.",
    "Edge cases such as reference_free and ipo are not handled at all in the agent implementation, leading to further deviation from the specification."
