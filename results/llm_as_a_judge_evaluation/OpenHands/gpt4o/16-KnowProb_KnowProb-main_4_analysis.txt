    "The agent implementation does not call build_counter_parametric_knowledge or get_objects_to_first_token_id_dict, which are essential for generating the correct counter-parametric knowledge as per the golden reference and the paper.",
    "Instead, it simply duplicates each parametric knowledge row nb_counter_parametric_knowledge times with placeholder values for 'all_dataset_objects_to_their_first_token_id' and 'parametric_knowledge_rel', and does not actually generate counterfactuals or use the required logic.",
    "The golden reference iterates over parametric knowledge and for each row, calls build_counter_parametric_knowledge with the correct arguments, collecting the results, which is missing in the agent implementation.",
    "As a result, the agent's function produces incorrect and incomplete results, not matching the intended counterfactual knowledge generation process."
