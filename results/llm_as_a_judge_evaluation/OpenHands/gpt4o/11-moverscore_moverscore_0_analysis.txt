    "The agent implementation does not perform the required pooling over the last 5 BERT layers (min, avg, max) as in the golden reference, which is crucial for the correct representation of token embeddings.",
    "The agent implementation computes the distance matrix directly between reference and hypothesis embeddings, whereas the golden reference concatenates n-gram representations and computes a larger distance matrix, which is essential for the correct application of EMD.",
    "The agent implementation does not handle n-gram sliding windows or the associated idf-weighted pooling, which is a core part of the golden reference's logic.",
    "The normalization and construction of the cost vectors for EMD are handled differently, leading to a fundamentally different (and incorrect) calculation of the MoverScore."
