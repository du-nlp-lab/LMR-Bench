    "The agent implementation of simpo_loss does not use the SimPO loss as described in the paper or as implemented in the golden reference. Instead, it computes the mean of the log probabilities as rewards and applies a fixed margin Bradley-Terry loss, which is not parameterized by beta, gamma_beta_ratio, or label_smoothing.",
    "The golden reference correctly implements the SimPO loss: it computes the log-ratio, applies the gamma_beta_ratio, and then uses either a sigmoid or hinge loss with the beta and label_smoothing parameters, as described in the SimPO paper.",
    "The agent's simpo_loss ignores the class's beta, gamma_beta_ratio, loss_type, and label_smoothing attributes, which are essential for the correct SimPO loss calculation.",
    "As a result, the agent's implementation will produce incorrect loss values and does not match the intended SimPO objective."
