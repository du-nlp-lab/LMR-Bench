    "The agent implementation saves the 'inputs' dictionary without the 'savedir' key, whereas the golden reference includes 'savedir' in the saved inputs pickle. This could affect reproducibility or downstream analysis expecting this field.",
    "The agent implementation passes 'layer_id' (1-based) to lib.plot_3d_feat_vit, while the golden reference passes 'layer_id - 1' (0-based). This could lead to mismatches in visualization labeling or file naming if the plotting function expects a 0-based index.",
    "Otherwise, the main logic of extracting features, enabling the custom block, running the model, and saving outputs is correct and matches the specification."
