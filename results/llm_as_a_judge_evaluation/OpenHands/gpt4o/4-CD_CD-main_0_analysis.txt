    "The core logic of concatenating hidden states, labels, splitting into train/test, training a logistic regression classifier, and computing accuracy, F1, and AUC per layer is correct and matches the reference.",
    "The agent uses test_size=0.2 in train_test_split, while the reference uses test_size=0.4. This changes the train/test split and could affect results.",
    "The agent omits the average='binary' argument in f1_score, which could cause issues if the labels are not strictly binary or if the data shape changes.",
    "The agent sets max_iter=1000 for LogisticRegression, which is more robust but not present in the reference; this is a minor difference but not a logic error."
