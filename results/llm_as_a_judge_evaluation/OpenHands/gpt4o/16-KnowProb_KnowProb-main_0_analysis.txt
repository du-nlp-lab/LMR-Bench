    "The agent implementation does not follow the leave-one-relation-group-out cross-validation logic of the golden reference. Instead, it groups by relation_group_id and only uses that group's data for both training and testing, rather than training on all other groups and testing on the held-out group.",
    "The agent's call to get_features_and_targets_for_dataset is incorrect: it is called once on the whole prompting_results, not separately for train and test splits as in the golden reference, and the arguments are in the wrong order.",
    "The agent's undersample_dataset usage is incorrect: it is called on a single group, not on the train/test splits as in the golden reference, and the function signature does not match.",
    "The agent implementation does not use parallelization (joblib.Parallel) for layer-wise classification, which is present in the golden reference and important for performance."
