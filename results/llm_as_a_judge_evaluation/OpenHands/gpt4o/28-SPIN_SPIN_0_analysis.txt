    "The agent implementation of `spin_loss` does not follow the SPIN loss as described in the paper or the golden reference: it computes `real_diff = policy_real_logps - opponent_real_logps` and then applies a logistic loss to each, summing them, which is not the correct SPIN loss.",
    "The correct SPIN loss (per the paper and golden reference) is based on the difference of log-ratios between policy and reference for real and generated samples, and then applies either a sigmoid or hinge loss to the difference, not a sum of two logistic losses.",
    "The agent implementation does not use the `beta` parameter or the `loss_type` (sigmoid/hinge) at all, which are essential to the SPIN loss definition.",
    "The rewards returned by the agent implementation are not the same as in the golden reference: they are logistic losses, not the (scaled) difference in log-probabilities as required."
