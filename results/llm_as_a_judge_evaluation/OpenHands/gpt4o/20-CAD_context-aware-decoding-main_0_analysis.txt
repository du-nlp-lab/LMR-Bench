    "The agent implementation does not perform autoregressive token generation; it only computes logits for the entire input and samples once, rather than generating tokens step-by-step as in the golden reference.",
    "The agent implementation does not adjust logits using the context-aware formula ((1+alpha)*full_context_logits - alpha*question_only_logits) as in the golden reference, nor does it handle the separation of context and question for contrastive adjustment.",
    "The agent implementation does not check for the EOS token or perform iterative generation up to max_length, which is essential for correct sequence generation.",
    "The agent's approach to contrastive scores (subtracting the mean of context logits) is not equivalent to the golden reference's method and will produce incorrect outputs."
