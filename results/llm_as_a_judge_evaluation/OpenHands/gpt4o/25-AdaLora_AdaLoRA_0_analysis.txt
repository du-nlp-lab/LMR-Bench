    "The agent's forward method in SVDLinear does not check for the 'merged' state, nor does it handle the fan_in_fan_out case, both of which are present in the golden reference and are crucial for correct behavior during training and evaluation.",
    "The agent's forward always adds the low-rank delta to the weight and passes it to F.linear, whereas the golden reference only adds the adaptation if not merged, and applies the adaptation as a separate term (not by modifying the weight), and also applies lora_dropout and the correct order of matrix multiplications ((lora_dropout(x) @ (lora_A * lora_E).T @ lora_B.T)).",
    "The agent's code will produce incorrect results in cases where merged weights are used (e.g., after eval()), and does not apply the SVD-based adaptation in the way described in the paper or the golden reference."
