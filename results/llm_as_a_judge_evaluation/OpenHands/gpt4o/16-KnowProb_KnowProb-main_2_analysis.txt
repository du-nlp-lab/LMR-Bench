    "The agent implementation checks for exact (case-sensitive) matches of parametric_object in the columns 'generation_object_1' and 'generation_subject_1', whereas the golden reference uses case-insensitive matching (via .lower()).",
    "The agent implementation checks if parametric_object is present in either column for any row, but the golden reference requires that parametric_object is not present in both columns (logical AND of not-in for both columns). The agent's logic will return True if parametric_object is missing from just one column, which is incorrect.",
    "The golden reference checks membership using .str.lower().tolist() for both columns, ensuring robust string comparison, while the agent's use of a lambda with a list may miss matches due to case or partial string issues."
