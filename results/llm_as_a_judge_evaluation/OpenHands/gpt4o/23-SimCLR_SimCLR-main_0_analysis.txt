    "The agent implementation incorrectly constructs the positive and negative pairs: it uses the diagonal of the similarity matrix as positives, which are self-similarities, not cross-view positives as required by SimCLR.",
    "The golden reference constructs a label matrix indicating which samples are positives (i.e., different augmentations of the same image) and carefully excludes self-similarities, while the agent simply uses the diagonal and off-diagonal elements, leading to incorrect positive/negative assignments.",
    "The agent's label tensor is just a range of indices, not the required all-zeros vector indicating the positive is always the first entry in the logits row, as in the golden reference.",
    "This results in the agent's loss not matching the InfoNCE loss as described in the SimCLR paper and the golden reference."
