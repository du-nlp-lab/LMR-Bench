    "The JS-divergence-based dynamic premature layer selection logic is not implemented as in the golden reference. Instead, the agent code computes a mean of mature and premature softmaxes and then subtracts a (miscomputed) JS divergence from the mature logits, rather than selecting the premature layer with the highest JS divergence.",
    "The agent code does not update or return the premature_layer_dist dictionary correctly, which is required for the output and tracked in the golden reference.",
    "The agent code's calculation of the JS divergence is incorrect: it averages the softmaxes and then computes KL divergences in a way that does not match the golden reference's per-layer, per-batch calculation and selection.",
    "These deviations will result in different token selection and output, failing to match the intended DoLa decoding behavior."
