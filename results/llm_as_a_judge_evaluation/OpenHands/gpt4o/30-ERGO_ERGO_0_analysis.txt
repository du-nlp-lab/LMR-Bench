    "The agent implementation computes the focal loss using a one-hot encoding and multiplies by self.alpha directly, but self.alpha is a vector of class weights and must be indexed per-sample according to the true label, not broadcast across all classes.",
    "The golden reference gathers the correct per-sample alpha and log-probability for the true class using .gather, while the agent's approach applies the weights to all classes and sums, which is mathematically incorrect and will yield wrong loss values.",
    "The agent's approach does not match the adaptive focal loss as described in the paper and the golden reference, leading to incorrect results especially when class weights (alpha) are not uniform."
