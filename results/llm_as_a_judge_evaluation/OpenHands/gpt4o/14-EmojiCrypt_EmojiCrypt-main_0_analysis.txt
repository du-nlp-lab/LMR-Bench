    "The core logic of computing mean cosine similarity between pairs of original and decrypted feature levels is correct: it iterates over the pairs, computes (mock) embeddings, calculates cosine similarity, accumulates, and averages.",
    "However, there is a subtle difference in how the cosine similarity is extracted: the agent implementation uses [0][0] to extract the scalar from the cosine_similarity output, while the golden reference does not (it just adds the matrix, which may result in a 1x1 array being summed, not a scalar). This could lead to a subtle difference in the type of mean_cosine_sim (scalar vs. array), which may cause issues in downstream code.",
    "The agent implementation always writes the results to a pickle file, while the golden reference has this line commented out. This is a minor difference but could affect reproducibility or file outputs.",
    "Both use mock embeddings, so the logic is not fully faithful to the real embedding scenario, but this is consistent between both and not a logic error per se."
