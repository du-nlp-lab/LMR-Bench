    "The agent implementation ignores the core sparse attention mechanism described in the golden reference, such as block-based selection, block_indices, block_counts, and windowed attention. Instead, it computes dense attention over all tokens.",
    "It does not use block_indices or block_counts at all, which are essential for the natively trainable sparse attention mechanism described in the paper and implemented in the golden reference.",
    "The agent implementation applies gate scores directly to the queries and then computes attention over the entire sequence, rather than restricting attention to selected blocks or sliding windows as required.",
    "Edge cases such as variable-length sequences (cu_seqlens), head_first format, and masking for invalid positions are not handled at all, leading to incorrect results in many scenarios."
