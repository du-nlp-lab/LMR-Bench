    "The agent implementation skips computing the overlap for (group_id_1, group_id_1) pairs (i.e., diagonal entries), setting them to missing, while the golden reference includes all pairs (including diagonal) in the output matrix.",
    "The agent implementation iterates over grouped_data (a generator), which is exhausted after the first outer loop, so only the first group is fully compared; subsequent groups will not be compared, leading to incomplete and incorrect results.",
    "The golden reference uses np.sum on a boolean Series to count overlaps, while the agent uses sum() on a boolean Series, which works, but the main issue is the incomplete coverage of all group pairs due to the generator exhaustion.",
    "The agent's output dict will be missing keys for (group_id_1, group_id_1) and possibly for other pairs, while the golden reference always returns a full square matrix with all group pairs."
