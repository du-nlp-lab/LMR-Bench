    "The function generate_counter_parametric_knowledge_dataset in the agent implementation is missing its core logic: it only contains the function signature, docstring, and a return statement for an undefined variable (counter_parametric_knowledge_df).",
    "It does not perform any of the required steps such as calling get_objects_to_first_token_id_dict, iterating over the parametric_knowledge DataFrame, or invoking build_counter_parametric_knowledge as specified in the golden reference.",
    "As a result, the function will fail at runtime due to the undefined variable and does not generate any counter-parametric knowledge, which is the main purpose of the function."
