    "The function uses 'or' to combine the two checks, meaning it returns True if the parametric_object is missing from either the object or subject columns, not both.",
    "According to the intent (and typical use-case), the function should only return True if the parametric_object is not present in both columns (i.e., use 'and'), otherwise it may incorrectly allow objects that are present in one column.",
    "This logic error can lead to false positives, where the function claims the object is not in the prompt even if it is present in one of the one-shot examples."
