    "The agent implementation of simpo_loss does not follow the SimPO loss as described in the paper or as implemented in the golden reference. Instead, it computes a 'reward gap' and a 'base loss' as the negative of this gap, then adds a KL regularization term, which is not part of the SimPO loss definition.",
    "The golden reference correctly computes the SimPO loss as a function of the difference in log probabilities (logits), applies a scaling and offset (beta, gamma_beta_ratio), and then applies either a sigmoid or hinge loss as specified, with optional label smoothing. The agent implementation does not do this, and instead applies label smoothing directly to the rewards, which is not correct.",
    "The agent's loss does not use the beta and gamma_beta_ratio parameters in the same way as the golden reference, and does not implement the sigmoid or hinge loss options as required by the SimPO paper.",
    "Therefore, the core algorithm in the agent's simpo_loss is incorrect and will produce wrong results."
