    "The agent's implementation of the focal loss matches the golden reference in all essential aspects: it computes the softmax/log-softmax, gathers the probabilities/log-probabilities for the true class, applies the alpha weighting, and the modulating factor (1 - p_t)^gamma, and reduces by mean or sum according to self.size_average.",
    "There are no off-by-one errors, missing checks, or edge case mishandling; the logic is clear and robust, and the output is equivalent to the golden reference.",
    "Both implementations handle the shape manipulations and device placement for alpha correctly, and the reduction (mean/sum) is performed as specified."
