    "The agent implementation only returns the first principal component (pca.components_[0]) for each layer, while the specification (golden reference) returns all principal components (pca_model.components_) as a matrix of shape (n_components, n_features).",
    "The golden reference also updates self.n_components to pca_model.n_components_ after fitting, but the agent code does not update this attribute, which could affect downstream code that expects this value to be current.",
    "The agent implementation reshapes the hidden states to 2D and centers them, but does not use the provided recenter function or store the mean in the same way as the golden reference, which could lead to subtle differences in centering and mean storage.",
    "These differences mean the agent's function will not produce the same output structure or values as the golden reference, leading to incorrect results."
