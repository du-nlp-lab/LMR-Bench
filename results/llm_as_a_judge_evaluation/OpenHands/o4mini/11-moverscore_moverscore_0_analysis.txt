    "The agent implementation computes the final score as 1/(1+emd), whereas the golden reference uses 1-emd, which is a fundamental difference and will produce different results.",
    "The agent only uses the last BERT layer for embeddings, while the golden reference combines min, avg, and max over the last 5 layers, concatenating them, which is a significant deviation from the intended representation.",
    "The agent does not implement n-gram pooling or the stride trick for n-gram aggregation as in the golden reference, which affects the granularity and weighting of the embeddings.",
    "The agent's distance matrix uses sqrt of squared distances (Euclidean), while the golden reference uses squared Euclidean distances directly, which may further alter the results."
