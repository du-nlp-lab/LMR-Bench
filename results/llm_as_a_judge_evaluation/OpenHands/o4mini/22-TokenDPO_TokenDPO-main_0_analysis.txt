    "The agent implementation of tdpo_loss computes chosen_rewards and rejected_rewards as 'beta * chosen_logps_margin - alpha * chosen_position_kl' and 'beta * rejected_logps_margin - alpha * rejected_position_kl', which does not match the reference/golden logic.",
    "The golden reference combines logps_margin and position_kl additively for rewards, and the loss is computed as -F.logsigmoid(beta * logits), where logits are constructed differently for TDPO1 and TDPO2. The agent implementation ignores the correct construction of logits and the use of .detach() for certain terms.",
    "The agent implementation does not handle the if_tdpo2 logic at all, and always uses a single formula, which is not faithful to the golden reference or the paper.",
    "As a result, the loss and reward calculations are fundamentally different and will produce incorrect results."
