    "The agent implementation leaves the core logic of the forward methods in HierarchyTransformerLoss, HyperbolicClusteringLoss, and HyperbolicCentripetalLoss as placeholders (with 'pass' or unimplemented TODOs), so no actual loss computation is performed.",
    "Without the computation of the clustering and centripetal losses, the function will not produce correct results and cannot be used as intended according to the paper and the golden reference."
