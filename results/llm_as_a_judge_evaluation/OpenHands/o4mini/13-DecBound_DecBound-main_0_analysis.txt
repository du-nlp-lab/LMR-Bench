    "The core logic of generate_tasks matches the golden reference: it generates num_tasks datasets using generate_x_y with incremented seeds and collects them into arrays.",
    "However, the agent implementation contains a duplicated block of code for generate_tasks (the function body is repeated twice, with the second block not indented under the function), which would cause a syntax error and prevent the code from running.",
    "There is no functional difference in the logic of the actual data generation, but the code duplication and indentation error is a subtle but critical implementation mistake."
