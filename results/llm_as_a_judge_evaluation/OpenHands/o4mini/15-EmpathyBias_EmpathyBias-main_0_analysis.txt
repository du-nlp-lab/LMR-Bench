    "The get_delta function in both the golden reference and agent implementation is identical: it computes the mean of in-group and out-group cells and returns their difference.",
    "The logic for determining in-group vs. out-group (via check_in_group) is also identical and correct for both the general and ethnicity-specific cases.",
    "There are no off-by-one errors, missing checks, or edge case mishandling in the implementation.",
    "The function is fully faithful to the intended specification as described in the context and the paper."
