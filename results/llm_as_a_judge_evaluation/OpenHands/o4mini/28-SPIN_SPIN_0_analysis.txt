    "The agent implementation of spin_loss computes real_rewards as policy_real_logps - beta * opponent_real_logps, whereas the correct formula (per the paper and the golden reference) is beta * (policy_real_logps - opponent_real_logps). The agent's formula is mathematically incorrect and will produce wrong reward values.",
    "The loss computation in the agent implementation uses F.softplus(-reward_diff) (where reward_diff = real_rewards - generated_rewards), but the correct SPIN loss is -log(sigmoid(beta * (pi_logratios - ref_logratios))). The agent's loss does not match the paper or the golden reference, leading to incorrect optimization.",
    "The handling of reference_free is also incorrect: the agent sets opponent_real_logps and opponent_generated_logps to zero, but the correct approach is to set ref_logratios to zero (i.e., ignore the reference model in the log-ratio), not to zero out the log-probs themselves.",
    "Overall, the agent's implementation deviates from the SPIN loss as described in the paper and the golden reference, resulting in incorrect loss and reward calculations."
