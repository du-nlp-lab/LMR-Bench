    "The core logic of the find_best_action function in the agent implementation matches the golden reference: it iterates over valid actions, computes the PUCT value for each, and selects the action with the highest value.",
    "However, there is a duplicated block of code at the end of the function (lines starting with 'P_sa = ...'), which is unreachable and redundant. This is a subtle implementation error, as it does not affect correctness but indicates a copy-paste or editing oversight.",
    "No edge cases or error conditions are mishandled, and the main algorithm is correct, but the presence of unreachable code is a minor but real implementation mistake."
