    "The agent implementation incorrectly computes the DPO loss: it sets chosen_rewards and rejected_rewards as (policy_logps - reference_logps) / beta, whereas the correct formula is beta * (policy_logps - reference_logps) (see the golden reference).",
    "The loss is computed as -F.logsigmoid(differences), where differences = chosen_rewards - rejected_rewards, but this is not equivalent to the DPO loss formula, which should be -F.logsigmoid(beta * (pi_logratios - ref_logratios)).",
    "The agent implementation ignores the beta scaling in the logits for the loss, and misapplies beta in the reward calculation, leading to incorrect gradients and reward values.",
    "The handling of reference_free is also incorrect: the agent sets reference logps to zero, but the correct approach is to set ref_logratios = 0 (i.e., the difference of reference logps), not the logps themselves."
