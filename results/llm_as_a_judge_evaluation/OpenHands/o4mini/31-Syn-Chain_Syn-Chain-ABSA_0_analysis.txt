    "The agent implementation contains two definitions of the spacy_result_to_conll function, which is redundant and could cause confusion or unexpected behavior.",
    "The second definition is incomplete and contains indentation errors, missing variable definitions (e.g., 'header'), and would result in a syntax or runtime error if executed.",
    "The first definition is logically correct and matches the golden reference in terms of output, but the presence of the incomplete second definition is a subtle but significant implementation mistake."
