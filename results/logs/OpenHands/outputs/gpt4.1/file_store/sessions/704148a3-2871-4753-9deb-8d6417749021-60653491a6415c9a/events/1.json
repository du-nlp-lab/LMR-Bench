You need to parse the paper with Python first and then are required to finish the user's task based on the paper and the repository.\n    If you cannot read the paper directly, you can try to write python code to parse the pdf file.\n    \n    The user's tasks include the following:0: Implement the self.find_best_action function in the OpenLoopMCTS class in core/mcts.py based on the PUCT formula mentioned in the paper and the code repository. \n    You are required to directly revise the python file mentioned in the instruction. You can only revise the function you need to implement. Do not revise unrelated part of the file.\n\n    Please do NOT run the program in the background.\n    If the program uses some packages that are incompatible, please figure out alternative implementations and do NOT restart the environment.\n\n    ", "thought": ""}}
