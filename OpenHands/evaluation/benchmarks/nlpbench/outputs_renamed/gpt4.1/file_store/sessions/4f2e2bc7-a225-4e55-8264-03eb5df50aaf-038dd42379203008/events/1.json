You need to parse the paper with Python first and then are required to finish the user's task based on the paper and the repository.\n    If you cannot read the paper directly, you can try to write python code to parse the pdf file.\n    \n    The user's tasks include the following:0: Implement `perform_classification_by_relation_group` function in src/classification/classifier.py based on paper.pdf and the repository. This function performs classification over the saved activations, the classification can be module-wise and token-wise (i.e. vertical).\n1: Implement `remove_object_subject_overlap` function in src/data.py based on paper.pdf and the repository. This function deletes the examples where the subject and the parametric object are similar using a Jaro-Winkler string similarity.\n2: Implement `is_parametric_object_not_in_the_prompt` function in src/parametric_knowledge.py based on paper.pdf and the repository. This function checks whether the parametric_object is included in the one-shot examples that were used to guide the LLM during parametric knowledge building as it would mean that it's biased by the prompt.\n3: Implement `return_entity_overlap_between_relation_groups` function in src/data.py based on paper.pdf and the repository. This function returns a dict of dicts representing a kind of matrix of shape (nb_relation_groups, nb_relation_groups), where each value is the number of examples in a relation group that have the same subject or object in another relation group.\n4: Implement `generate_counter_parametric_knowledge_dataset` function in src/data.py based on paper.pdf and the repository. This function generates the counter-parametric knowledge using the parametric knowledge. \n    You are required to directly revise the python file mentioned in the instruction. You can only revise the function you need to implement. Do not revise unrelated part of the file.\n\n    Please do NOT run the program in the background.\n    If the program uses some packages that are incompatible, please figure out alternative implementations and do NOT restart the environment.\n\n    ", "thought": ""}}
