We\\npropose a simple decoding strategy for reducing hallucinations with pretrained LLMs\\nthat does not require conditioning on retrieved external knowledge nor additional fine-\\ntuning. Our approach obtains the next-token distribution by contrasting the differences\\nin logits obtained from projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary\\nspace, exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shown to\\nbe localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding by C ontrasting\\nLayers (DoLa) approach is able to better surface factual knowledge and reduce the gen-\\neration of incorrect facts. DoLa consistently improves the truthfulness across multiple\\nchoices tasks and open-ended generation tasks, for example improving the performance\\nof LLaMA family models on TruthfulQA by 12-17% absolute points, demonstrating its\\npotential in making LLMs reliably generate truthful facts.1\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in numerous natural language processing\\n(NLP) applications (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2022; 2023). However, despite the continued increase in\\nperformance and the emergence of new capabilities from scaling LLMs (Wei et al., 2022a), their tendency to\\n\u201challucinate\u201d, i.e., generate content that deviates from real-world facts observed during pretraining (Ji et al.,\\n2023), remains a persistent challenge.
