Nevertheless, they\\nalso introduce privacy concerns: firstly, numer-\\nous studies underscore the risks to user pri-\\nvacy posed by jailbreaking cloud-based LLMs;\\nsecondly, the LLM service providers have ac-\\ncess to all user data, which deters individuals\\nfrom confidently utilizing such services. To\\naddress such concerns, we propose a simple\\nyet effective paradigm, EmojiPrompt , to pro-\\ntect user privacy. At its core, EmojiPrompt\\nperforms generative transformation, obfuscat-\\ning private data within prompts with linguistic\\nand non-linguistic elements before submitting\\nthem to cloud-based LLMs. We evaluate Emo-\\njiPrompt\u2019s performance across 8 datasets from\\nvarious domains. We also propose simulated in-\\nference attacks to assess EmojiPrompt\u2019s ability\\nto preserve user privacy. The results demon-\\nstrate that EmojiPrompt effectively obfuscates\\nuser private data, while largely maintaining,\\nor even enhancing, performances compared to\\nthe unobfuscated version. Furthermore, Emo-\\njiPrompt\u2019s atomic-level obfuscation allows it to\\nfunction exclusively with cloud-based LLMs.\\nFor source code, please refer to: https://\\ngithub.com/agiresearch/EmojiCrypt .\\n1 Introduction\\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) have substantially expanded their applica-\\nbility across diverse fields, such as personalized\\nrecommendations, health report analysis, and finan-\\ncial decision-making (Bubeck et al., 2023; Li et al.,\\n2023; Yu et al., 2024; Jin et al., 2024b; Fang et al.,\\n2024; Sui et al., 2024).
