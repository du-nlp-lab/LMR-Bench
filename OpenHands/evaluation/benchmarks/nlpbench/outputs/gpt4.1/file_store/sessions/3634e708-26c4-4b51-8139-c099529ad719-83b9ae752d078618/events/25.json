Since the process follows a chain\nstructure, if an earlier step is incorrect, subsequent\nsteps are not evaluated (e.g., if Step 1 is incorrect,\nStep 2 andStep 3 are not considered). The evalua-\ntion is conducted independently by three master\u2019s\nstudents with expertise in English and natural lan-\nguage processing (NLP). To mitigate the risk of\noverlooking errors in the lengthy model responses,\na consensus-based approach is adopted to resolve\nany discrepancies among the evaluators.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, GPT-4o rarely makes mis-\ntakes in Step 1 , demonstrating a solid understand-\ning of the provided syntactic information. In con-\ntrast, Llama-3-8B exhibits more errors in syntac-\ntic comprehension. Additionally, we observe that\nGPT-4o\u2019s outputs are more structured and easier\nto read (see Fig. 5 in the Appendix). Both models\nshow higher error rates in Step 2 than in Step 3 ,\nas the sentiment inclination is often conveyed in\nStep 2 , making it account for a higher proportion\nof errors in these sentiment misclassi\ufb01cation cases.\nThis also highlights the importance of generating\nreasoning information conditioned on sentiment la-\nbels when constructing Syn-Chain \ufb01ne-tuning data,\nwhich avoid inconsistencies between reasoning and\nsentiment labels.\n5.2 Syn-Chain Fine-tuning\nBaseline.
