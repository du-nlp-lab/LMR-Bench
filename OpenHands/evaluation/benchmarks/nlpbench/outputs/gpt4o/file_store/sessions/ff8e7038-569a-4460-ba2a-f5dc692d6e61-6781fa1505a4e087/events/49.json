However, to ensure robustness, it would be prudent to verify the implementation with some test cases or examples. This would help confirm that the function behaves as expected and aligns with the theoretical underpinnings described in the paper. Since the repository might not have a testing framework set up, I should check for any existing test files or examples that could be used to validate the function. If none exist, I might consider creating a simple test script to verify the functionality.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "call_zPmzyNhUDvCTryfAEGEOwiZB", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 13376, "total_tokens": 13501, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 13312}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
