The paper might suggest a more nuanced approach to adjusting the logits or sampling process that I have not captured.\\n\\nTo address this, I will:\\n1. Revisit the paper to look for any specific details or formulas related to context-aware decoding that I might have missed.\\n2. Consider alternative methods for incorporating context into the generation process, such as adjusting the sampling temperature or using a different method to combine logits.\\n3.
