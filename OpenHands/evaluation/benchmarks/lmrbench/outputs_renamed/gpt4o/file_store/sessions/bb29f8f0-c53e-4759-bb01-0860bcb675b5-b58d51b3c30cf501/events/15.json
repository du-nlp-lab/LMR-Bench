Since the paper.pdf could not be found, I will need to implement the InfoNCE loss based on general knowledge of the SimCLR method. The InfoNCE loss is typically computed by comparing positive pairs (augmented views of the same image) against negative pairs (augmented views of different images) using a contrastive loss function. The implementation will involve computing similarity scores using a dot product, applying a temperature scaling, and then using a cross-entropy loss to distinguish positive pairs from negative pairs. I will proceed to implement this in the `info_nce_loss` function.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "call_3O8P78nLaf3cpLvWrIUUe6dT", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 5745, "total_tokens": 5912, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 4480}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
