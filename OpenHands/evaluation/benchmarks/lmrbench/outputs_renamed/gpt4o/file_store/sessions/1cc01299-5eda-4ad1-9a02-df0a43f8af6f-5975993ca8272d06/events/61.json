This suggests that there might be a problem with how the module is structured or how the script is being executed. One potential solution is to ensure that the 'repe' directory is treated as a package by verifying the presence of an __init__.py file, which is already confirmed. Another approach is to modify the script execution context to ensure the module path is recognized. I should also consider checking for any environment-specific issues that might affect module recognition, such as virtual environment settings or Python version compatibility.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "call_noltkFWcjNNarnlf3htLTx3K", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 19944, "total_tokens": 20076, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 19712}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
