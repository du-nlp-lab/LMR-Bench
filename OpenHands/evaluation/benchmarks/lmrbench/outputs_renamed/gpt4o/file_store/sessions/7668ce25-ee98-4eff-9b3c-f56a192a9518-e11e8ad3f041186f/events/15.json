This involves generative transformation using emojis and other symbols. The task is to implement the `compute_mean_cosine_similarity` function, which calculates the mean cosine similarity between pairs of encrypted and decrypted feature levels. The function should:\\n\\n1. Extract the original and decrypted values from the `enc_dec_pairs` dictionary.\\n2. Generate embeddings for these values using a suitable model.\\n3. Compute the cosine similarity between these embeddings.\\n4. Calculate the mean cosine similarity across all pairs.\\n5. Save the results to a file.\\n\\nThe existing code in `Tabular.py` provides a structure for this function, but the actual embedding generation and similarity computation need to be implemented. The paper likely provides insights into the embedding process or the model used, which I need to explore further in the extracted text.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "call_ztgb88hTS6ztFHV7LN5Mh5eq", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 211, "prompt_tokens": 8525, "total_tokens": 8736, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 8192}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
