In this\npaper, we propose a novel Event Relational\nGraph Transf Ormer (ERGO) framework1for\nDECI, to ease the graph construction and im-\nprove it over the noisy edge issue. Different\nfrom conventional event graphs, we define a\npair of events as a node and build a complete\nevent relational graph without any prior knowl-\nedge or tools. This naturally formulates DECI\nas a node classification problem, and thus we\ncapture the causation transitivity among event\npairs via a graph transformer. Furthermore,\nwe design a criss-cross constraint and an adap-\ntive focal loss for the imbalanced classification,\nto alleviate the issues of false positives and\nfalse negatives. Extensive experiments on two\nbenchmark datasets show that ERGO greatly\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods (12.8% F1 gains on average).\n1 Introduction\nEvent Causality Identification (ECI) is the task of\nidentifying if the occurrence of one event causes\nanother in text. As shown in Figure 1, given the text\n\u201c... the outage2was caused by a terrestrial break in\nthe fiber in Egypt ... \u201d, where \u201c outage2\u201d and \u201c break \u201d\nare event triggers, an ECI model should predict\nif they have a cau\ntion will easily confuse\nthe model into false-negative predictions. Second,\nto ease the graph construction, we assume that all\nnodes can pass information with each other via the\ncomplete graph structure. While there are many\nspurious correlations between events, which can be\nincorrectly propagated to neighbor nodes, leading\nto severe false positives. For example, \u201ctreatment\u201d\nand \u201cdeath\u201d frequently co-occur in the same docu-\nment, but there is no causality between them since\nit is not \u201ctreatment\u201d that causes \u201cdeath\u201d.\nTo address the above issues, we further design\nacriss-cross constraint and an adaptive focal loss.\nThe criss-cross constraint simplifies the paths of\neach pair of events for global inference. Instead\nof a complete graph, we assume that there is an\nedge between two nodes, only if the two pairs of\nevents share at least one event. Clearly, if they\nhave no common event, there must be no direct\ncausal effect between them. The adaptive focal\nloss re-weights positive and negative samples to\ntackle the imbalance issue. On the one hand, we\nleverage a weighting factor to balance two classes\u2019\ntraining. On the other hand, we also introduce a\nscaling factor to focus more on difficult samples.\nOur cont\nle, \u201ctreatment\u201d\nand \u201cdeath\u201d frequently co-occur in the same docu-\nment, but there is no causality between them since\nit is not \u201ctreatment\u201d that causes \u201cdeath\u201d.\nTo address the above issues, we further design\nacriss-cross constraint and an adaptive focal loss.\nThe criss-cross constraint simplifies the paths of\neach pair of events for global inference.

Zuo et al. (2021a) learn context-\nspecific causal patterns from external causal state-\nments and incorporate them into a target ECI model.\nZuo et al. (2021b) propose a data augmentation\nmethod to further solve the data lacking problem.\nAlong with the success of sentence-level natural\nlanguage understanding, many tasks are extended\nto the entire document, such as relation extraction\n(Yao et al., 2019), natural language inference (Yin\net al., 2021), and event argument extraction (Ma\net al., 2022a). A concurrent and relevant work is\n(Tan et al., 2022), which also leverages focal loss\nfor entity relation extraction. The difference is that\nthe focal loss in (Tan et al., 2022) is used to make\nlong-tail (positive) classes contribute more to the\noverall loss, while the focal loss in our ERGO tack-\nles the imbalance issue of DECI task by focusing\nmore on difficult samples. We further leverage a\n2120weighting factor in the focal loss to balance two\nclasses\u2019 training, which is not considered in (Tan\net al., 2022). Moreover, in Section 4.6, we have\ngiven a more detailed analysis of the impact of\nadaptive focal loss on the DECI task.\nCompared with SECI, DECI not only aggra-\nvates t\nal patterns from external causal state-\nments and incorporate them into a target ECI model.\nZuo et al.
