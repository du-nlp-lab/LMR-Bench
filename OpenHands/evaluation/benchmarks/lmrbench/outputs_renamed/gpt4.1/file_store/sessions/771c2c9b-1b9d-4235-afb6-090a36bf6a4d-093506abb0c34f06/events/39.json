The authors should\npreferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis\nof Normality of errors is not verified.\n\u2022For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or\nfigures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative\nerror rates).\n\u2022If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how\nthey were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.\n8.Experiments Compute Resources\nQuestion: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-\nputer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce\nthe experiments?\nAnswer: [Yes]\nJustification: We provide the compute in the appendix.\nGuidelines:\n\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.\n\u2022The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,\nor cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.\n\u2022The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual\nexperimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.\n\u2022The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute\nthan the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that\ndidn\u2019t make it into the paper).\n9.Code Of Ethics\nQuestion: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the\nNeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?\nAnswer: [Yes]\nJustification: The paper conforms to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.\nGuidelines:\n\u2022The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.\n\u2022If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a\ndeviation from the Code of Ethics.\n\u2022The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-\neration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).\n10.Broader Impacts\nQuestion: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative\nsocietal impacts of the work performed?\nAnswer: [NA]\nJustification: Our work does not have societal impact.\nGuidelines:\n\u2022 The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.\n\u2022If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal\nimpact or why the paper does not address societal impact.\n\u2022Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses\n(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations\n(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific\ngroups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.\n23\n[Jupyter current working directory: /workspace/benchmark/datasets]\n[Jupyter Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]", "extras": {"code": "# Try page 22 for Appendix G (page 22)\nprint(reader.pages[22].extract_text())"}, "success": true}
