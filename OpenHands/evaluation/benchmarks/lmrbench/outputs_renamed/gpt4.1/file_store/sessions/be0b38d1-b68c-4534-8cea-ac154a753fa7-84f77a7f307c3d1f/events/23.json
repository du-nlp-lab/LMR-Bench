However, the corre-\nlation between the effectiveness of CoT and the\nlength of reasoning steps in prompts remains\nlargely unknown. To shed light on this, we\nhave conducted several empirical experiments\nto explore the relations. Specifically, we de-\nsign experiments that expand and compress the\nrationale reasoning steps within CoT demon-\nstrations while keeping all other factors con-\nstant. We have the following key findings. First,\nthe results indicate that lengthening the reason-\ning steps in prompts, even without adding new\ninformation into the prompt, considerably en-\nhances LLMs\u2019 reasoning abilities across multi-\nple datasets. Alternatively, shortening the rea-\nsoning steps, even while preserving the key\ninformation, significantly diminishes the rea-\nsoning abilities of models. This finding high-\nlights the importance of the number of steps in\nCoT prompts and provides practical guidance\nto make better use of LLMs\u2019 potential in com-\nplex problem-solving scenarios. Second, we\nalso investigated the relationship between the\nperformance of CoT and the rationales used in\ndemonstrations. Surprisingly, the result shows\nthat even incorrect rationales can yield favor-\nable outcomes if they maintain the requisite\nlength of inference. Third, we observed that\nthe advantages of increasing reasoning steps\nare task-dependent: simpler tasks require fewer\nsteps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly\nfrom longer i\n[Jupyter current working directory: /workspace/benchmark/datasets]\n[Jupyter Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]", "extras": {"code": "from PyPDF2 import PdfReader\npdf_path = './8-StepLength/stepLength-main/paper.pdf'\nreader = PdfReader(pdf_path)\nnum_pages = len(reader.pages)\ntext = ''\nfor i in range(min(num_pages, 5)):\n    text += reader.pages[i].extract_text() + '\\n'\nprint(text[:2000])"}, "success": true}
