This includes details about training, license,\nlimitations, etc.\n\u2022The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose\nasset is used.\n\u2022At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either\ncreate an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.\n14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects\nQuestion: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper\ninclude the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as\nwell as details about compensation (if any)?\nAnswer: [NA]\nJustification: we don\u2019t have any.\nGuidelines:\n\u2022The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with\nhuman subjects.\n\u2022Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-\ntion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be\nincluded in the main paper.\n\u2022According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,\nor other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data\ncollector.\n15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human\nSubjects\nQuestion: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether\nsuch risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)\napprovals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or\ninstitution) were obtained?\nAnswer: [NA]\nJustification: We don\u2019t have this.\nGuidelines:\n\u2022The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with\nhuman subjects.\n\u2022Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)\nmay be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you\nshould clearly state this in the paper.\n\u2022We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions\nand locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the\nguidelines for their institution.\n\u2022For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if\napplicable), such as the institution conducting the review.\n25\n[Jupyter current working directory: /workspace/benchmark/datasets]\n[Jupyter Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]", "extras": {"code": "# Try page 24 for Appendix G (page 24)\nprint(reader.pages[24].extract_text())"}, "success": true}
