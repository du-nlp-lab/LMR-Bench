In general. releasing code and data is often\none good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed\ninstructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case\nof a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are\nappropriate to the research performed.\n\u2022While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-\nsions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the\nnature of the contribution. For example\n(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how\nto reproduce that algorithm.\n(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe\nthe architecture clearly and fully.\n(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should\neither be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce\nthe model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct\nthe dataset).\n(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case\nauthors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.\nIn the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in\nsome way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers\nto have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.\n5.Open access to data and code\nQuestion: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-\ntions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental\nmaterial?\n21\n[Jupyter current working directory: /workspace/benchmark/datasets]\n[Jupyter Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]", "extras": {"code": "# Try to extract Appendix G for more details on synthetic data generation\nprint(reader.pages[20].extract_text())"}, "success": true}
