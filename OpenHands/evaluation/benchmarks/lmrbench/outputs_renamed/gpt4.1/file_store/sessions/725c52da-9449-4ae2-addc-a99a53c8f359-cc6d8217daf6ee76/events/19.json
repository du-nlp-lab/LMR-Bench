Existing works usu-\nally build an event graph for global reasoning\nacross multiple sentences. However, the edges\nbetween events have to be carefully designed\nthrough heuristic rules or external tools. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Event Relational\nGraph Transf Ormer (ERGO) framework1for\nDECI, to ease the graph construction and im-\nprove it over the noisy edge issue. Different\nfrom conventional event graphs, we define a\npair of events as a node and build a complete\nevent relational graph without any prior knowl-\nedge or tools. This naturally formulates DECI\nas a node classification problem, and thus we\ncapture the causation transitivity among event\npairs via a graph transformer. Furthermore,\nwe design a criss-cross constraint and an adap-\ntive focal loss for the imbalanced classification,\nto alleviate the issues of false positives and\nfalse negatives. Extensive experiments on two\nbenchmark datasets show that ERGO greatly\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods (12.8% F1 gains on average).\n1 Introduction\nEvent Causality Identification (ECI) is the task of\nidentifying if the occurrence of one event causes\nanother in text. As shown in Figure 1, given the text\n\u201c... the outage2was caused by a terrestrial break in\nthe fiber in Egypt ... \u201d, where \u201c outage2\u201d and \u201c break \u201d\nare event triggers, an ECI model should predict\nif they have a causal relation or not. Discovering\ncausal relationships not only helps to deeply un-\nderstand how the world progresses, but also is an\nimportant goal of empirical research in various ar-\neas, such as machine reading comprehension (Be-\nrant et al., 2014), question answering (Oh et al.,\n2016), future event forecasting (Hashimoto, 2019),\n\u2217Corresponding author.\n1https://github.com/chenmeiqii/ERGO.git\nFigure 1: Example of DECI. Solid purple lines denote\ntarget causal relations.\nand event knowledge graph construction (Ma et al.,\n2022b).\nCausality is usually implicit in natural lan-\nguage (Copley and Martin, 2014), especially when\nevents scatter in a document, a.k.a. Document-level\nECI (DECI). Recent methods typically construct\nan event graph to assist the global inference across\nmultiple sentences, where nodes are events and\nedges are their relations, such as linguistic depen-\ndency or adjacent contexts (Gao et al., 2019; Zhao\net al., 2021). However, there are two major issues.\nFirst, the edges heavily rely on external tools and\nheuristic rules, which are not always reliable and\nmay intr\n[Jupyter current working directory: /workspace/benchmark/datasets]\n[Jupyter Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]", "extras": {"code": "import PyPDF2\n\npdf_path = '/workspace/benchmark/datasets/30-ERGO/ERGO/paper.pdf'\ntext = ''\nwith open(pdf_path, 'rb') as f:\n    reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(f)\n    for page in reader.pages:\n        text += page.extract_text() + '\\n'\nprint(text[:3000])"}, "success": true}
