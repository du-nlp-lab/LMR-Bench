Papers cannot be rejected simply for not\nincluding code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source\nbenchmark).\n\u2022The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to\nreproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:\n//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.\n\u2022The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how\nto access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.\n\u2022The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new\nproposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they\nshould state which ones are omitted from the script and why.\n\u2022At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized\nversions (if applicable).\n\u2022Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the\npaper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.\n6.Experimental Setting/Details\nQuestion: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-\nparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the\nresults?\nAnswer: [Yes]\nJustification: We present complete method and experiment details in Section 3 and 4.\nGuidelines:\n\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.\n\u2022The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail\nthat is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.\n\u2022The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental\nmaterial.\n7.Experiment Statistical Significance\nQuestion: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate\ninformation about the statistical significance of the experiments?\nAnswer: [Yes]\nJustification: Although we do not provide error bar for every plot, this is due to the nature of\nour work, since we are visualizing the decision boundary for qualitative understanding. We\njustify this with additional plots in various settings in the appendix. Apart from the decision\nboundary plots, we do plot the accuracy plot with error bar.\nGuidelines:\n\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.\n\u2022The authors should answer \"Yes\" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-\ndence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support\nthe main claims of the paper.\n\u2022The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for\nexample, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall\nrun with given experimental conditions).\n\u2022The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,\ncall to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)\n22\n[Jupyter current working directory: /workspace/benchmark/datasets]\n[Jupyter Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]", "extras": {"code": "# Try the next page for Appendix G (page 21)\nprint(reader.pages[21].extract_text())"}, "success": true}
