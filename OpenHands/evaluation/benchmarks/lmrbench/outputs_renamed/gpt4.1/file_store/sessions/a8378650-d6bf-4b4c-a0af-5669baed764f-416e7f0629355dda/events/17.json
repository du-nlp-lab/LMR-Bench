To mitigate this issue, we present\\ncontext-aware decoding (CAD), which follows\\na contrastive output distribution that amplifies\\nthe difference between the output probabilities\\nwhen a model is used with and without con-\\ntext. Our experiments show that CAD, without\\nadditional training, significantly improves the\\nfaithfulness of different LM families, including\\nOPT, GPT, LLaMA and FLAN-T5 for summa-\\nrization tasks (e.g., 14.3% gain for LLaMA in\\nfactuality metrics). Furthermore, CAD is par-\\nticularly effective in overriding a model\u2019s prior\\nknowledge when it contradicts the provided\\ncontext, leading to substantial improvements in\\ntasks where resolving the knowledge conflict is\\nessential.\\n1 Introduction\\nLanguage models (LMs) are remarkably effective\\nin generating coherent and fluent continuations of\\na prompt or document prefix. During generation,\\nthey mostly rely on two sources of knowledge: (1)\\nprior knowledge , which is learned during pretrain-\\ning and stored implicitly within the model parame-\\nters; (2) context knowledge , which is passed as in-\\nputs in the prefix context (Chan et al., 2022). How-\\never, it remains an open question how a pretrained\\nLM, particularly a vanilla LM without task-specific\\nfinetuning, balances these two knowledge sources\\nduring generation.\\nPrevious research shows that LMs can fail to pay\\nenough attention to new information introduced\\nin the context knowledge. This can lead to hallu-\\ncination in summarization (Maynez et al., 2020;\\nPagnoni et al., 2021), where the generated sum-\\nmaries include facts not present in the input doc-\\nument. Insufficient attention to context is espe-\\ncially problematic when the context knowledge\\n\u2217Equal contribution.

For instance, when\\nLLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) is presented with a\\nlatest document \u201cArgentina won the FIFA World\\nCups in 1978,1986 and 2022 ...\u201d in its context (Fig-\\nure 1), it still predicts \u201cTwo\u201d in response to the\\nquestion \u201cHow many World Cups have Argentina\\nwon?\u201d, due in part to the outdated training data.\\nIn this work, we present a simple context- aware\\ndecoding (CAD) method to encourage the LM to\\nattend to its context during generation. As shown\\nin Figure 1, CAD samples from a new output dis-\\ntribution, which amplifies the difference between\\noutput probabilities with and without the context\\ndocument. This provides a new form of contrastive\\ndecoding (Li et al., 2022), which effectively down-\\nweights the prior knowledge'\n[Jupyter current working directory: /workspace/benchmark/datasets]\n[Jupyter Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]", "extras": {"code": "# Let's extract more of the paper to find the method section and the details of context-aware decoding (CAD)\nmethod_section = ''\nfor i, page in enumerate(reader.pages):\n    page_text = page.extract_text()\n    if 'context-aware decoding' in page_text.lower() or 'method' in page_text.lower():\n        method_section += f'--- Page {i+1} ---\\n' + page_text + '\\n'\nmethod_section[:3000]"}, "success": true}
