The paper suggests that different layers of a language model capture different levels of concept complexity, which aligns with the task of probing different layers to evaluate their effectiveness.\\n\\nTo implement this function, we need to:\\n1. Iterate over each layer of the model.\\n2. For each layer, extract the hidden states for both `rp_log_data_list` and `rp_question_data_list`.\\n3. Use these hidden states as features to train a logistic regression classifier.\\n4. Evaluate the classifier using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and AUC.\\n5. Return the evaluation metrics for each layer.\\n\\nThe function signature already includes the necessary parameters: `rp_log_data_list`, `rp_question_data_list`, `labels_log`, `labels_question`, and `tot_layer`. We will use these to implement the probing logic.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "call_UqNVG7zhMYN4G1o0j6SwSx1p", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 5180, "total_tokens": 5406, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 4864}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
