The min values and max\nvalues of each Mare in Table 7 (\u00a7C.2). We observe that the mean decreases as the standard deviation increases for\nstricter personas (P2 and P3). It is the opposite trend when the origin narrative is rewritten (T1 and T2).\nwith the perceiver in-group identity or experiencer\nin-group identity). We discuss both in detail below.\nRace or ethnicity, nationality and religion\ngroups all show higher predicted intensities for\nin-group pairs. From the summarized \u03b4in Ta-\nble 2, we see that across almost all groups, prompt\nvariations and LLMs, there is a robust positive\nintergroup gap, with z-scores as much as 3.78.\nThe majority of exceptions to this are with the\nlarger Llama-70B, where, especially for religion,\nwe sometimes see a negative gap (though often\nsmall in magnitude). The average empathy gap\nranges from 0.13(Llama-70B) to 2.11(Llama-8B),\nwith Mistral ( 0.77) and Qwen ( 1.20) in the middle.\nFor race or ethnicity groups, where we test iden-\ntity name variations for the same social group, in\nLlama-8B models, we consistently observe a clear\nand distinct block-diagonal pattern (Figure 3 and\nthe first row of Figure 2), where a lower gap is\nseen for in-group comparisons than for out-group\ncomparisons. We also see that when the perceiver\nis White, the out-group gap is generally lower; thisis likely due to a defaulting effect where unspeci-\nfied perceiver is \u201cassumed to be\u201d White (Sun et al.,\n2023). For other models,9while the deviation is\nsmall, masked cells are mostly in diagonal blocks,\nshowing out-group predictions might follow differ-\nent distributions from in-group pairs.\nPrompt settings influences the intergroup gap.\nWith results of Llama-8B in Figure 2 and Table 3,\nwe observe the effects of prompt variations on\nmodel behaviors from three aspects.
