However, we use contextual embeddings, which capture the speci\ufb01c use of\na token in a sentence, and potentially capture sequence information. We do not use external tools\nto generate linguistic structures, which makes our approach relatively simple and portable to new\nlanguages. Instead of greedy matching, WMD (Kusner et al., 2015), WMD O(Chow et al., 2019), and\nSMS (Clark et al., 2019) propose to use optimal matching based on earth mover\u2019s distance (Rubner\net al., 1998). The tradeoff1between greedy and optimal matching was studied by Rus & Lintean\n(2012). Sharma et al. (2018) compute similarity with sentence-level representations. In contrast, our\ntoken-level computation allows us to weigh tokens differently according to their importance.\n2.4 L EARNED METRICS\nVarious metrics are trained to optimize correlation with human judgments. B EER (Stanojevi \u00b4c &\nSima\u2019an, 2014) uses a regression model based on character n-grams and word bigrams. B LEND (Ma\net al., 2017) uses regression to combine 29 existing metrics. R USE (Shimanaka et al., 2018) com-\nbines three pre-trained sentence embedding models. All these methods require costly human judg-\nments as supervision for each dataset, and risk poor generalization to new domains, even within a\nknown language and task (Chaganty et al., 2018). Cui et al. (2018) and Lowe et al. (2017) train a\nneural model to predict if the input text is human-generated. This approach also has the risk of being\noptimized to existing data and generalizing poorly to new data. In contrast, the model underlying\nBERTS CORE is not optimized for any speci\ufb01c evaluation task.\n3 BERTS CORE\nGiven a reference sentence x=hx1;:::;x kiand a candidate sentence ^x=h^x1;:::; ^xli, we use\ncontextual embeddings to represent the tokens, and compute matching usin\n[Jupyter current working directory: /workspace/benchmark/datasets]\n[Jupyter Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]", "extras": {"code": "# Let's print more text around the next 'greedy' match for more details\nidx = 9950\nprint(text[max(0, idx-500):idx+1500])"}, "success": true}
