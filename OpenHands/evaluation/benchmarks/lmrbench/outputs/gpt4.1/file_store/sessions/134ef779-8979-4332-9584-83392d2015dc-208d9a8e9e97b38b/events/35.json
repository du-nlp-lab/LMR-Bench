In this study,\nwe investigate how this aspect of intergroup\nrelations in humans is replicated by LLMs in\nan emotion intensity prediction task. In this\ntask, the LLM is given a short description of\nan experience a person had that caused them\nto feel a particular emotion; the LLM is then\nprompted to predict the intensity of the emo-\ntion the person experienced on a numerical\nscale. By manipulating the group identities as-\nsigned to the LLM\u2019s persona (the \u201cperceiver\u201d)\nand the person in the narrative (the \u201cexperi-\nencer\u201d), we measure how predicted emotion in-\ntensities differ between in-group and out-group\nsettings. We observe that LLMs assign higher\nemotion intensity scores to in-group members\nthan out-group members. This pattern holds\nacross all three types of social groupings we\ntested: race/ethnicity, nationality, and religion.\nWe perform an in-depth analysis on Llama-3.1-\n8B, the model which exhibited strongest inter-\ngroup bias among those tested.1\n1 Introduction\n\u201cPeople are often motivated to increase others\u2019\npositive experiences and to alleviate others\u2019 suf-\nfering ...
