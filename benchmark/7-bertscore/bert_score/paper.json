We evaluate using the outputs of 363 machine translation and image\ncaptioning systems. BERTSCORE correlates better with human judgments and\nprovides stronger model selection performance than existing metrics. Finally, we\nuse an adversarial paraphrase detection task to show that BERTSCORE is more\nrobust to challenging examples when compared to existing metrics.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nAutomatic evaluation of natural language generation, for example in machine translation and caption\ngeneration, requires comparing candidate sentences to annotated references. The goal is to evaluate\nsemantic equivalence. However, commonly used methods rely on surface-form similarity only. For\nexample, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), the most common machine translation metric, simply counts\nn-gram overlap between the candidate and the reference. While this provides a simple and general\nmeasure, it fails to account for meaning-preserving lexical and compositional diversity.\nIn this paper, we introduce BERTSCORE, a language generation evaluation metric based on pre-\ntrained BERT contextual embeddings (Devlin et al., 2019). BERTSCORE computes the similarity\nof two sentences as a sum of cosine similarities between their tokens’ embeddings.\nBERTSCORE addresses two common pitfalls in n-gram-based metrics (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005).\nFirst, such methods often fail to robustly match paraphrases. For example, given the reference peo-\nple like foreign cars, BLEU and METEOR (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005) incorrectly give a higher score\nto people like visiting places abroad compared to consumers prefer imported cars. This leads to\nperformance underestimation when semantically-correct phrases are penalized because they differ\nfrom the surface form of the reference. In contrast to string matching (e.g., in BLEU) or matching\nheuristics (e.g., in METEOR), we compute similarity using contextualized token embeddings, which\nhave been shown to be effective for paraphrase detection (Devlin et al., 2019). Second, n-gram mod-\nels fail to capture distant dependencies and penalize semantically-critical ordering changes (Isozaki\net al., 2010). For example, given a small window of size two, BLEU will only mildly penalize\nswapping of cause and effect clauses (e.g. A because B instead of B because A), especially when\nthe arguments A and B are long phrases. In contrast, contextualized embeddings are trained to\neffectively capture distant dependencies and ordering.\nWe experiment with BERTSCORE on machine translation and image captioning tasks using the\noutputs of 363 systems by correlating BERTSCORE and related metrics to available human judg-\nments. Our experiments demonstrate that BERTSCORE correlates highly with human evaluations.\nIn machine translation, BERTSCORE shows stronger system-level and segment-level correlations\nwith human judgments than existing metrics on multiple common benchmarks and demonstrates\n∗Equal contribution. † Work done at Cornell.\n1\narXiv:1904.09675v3  [cs.CL]  24 Feb 2020\n",

Given\na reference sentence x tokenized to k tokens ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩and a candidate ˆx tokenized to l tokens\n⟨ˆx1, . . . , ˆxl⟩, a generation evaluation metric is a function f(x, ˆx) ∈R. Better metrics have a higher\ncorrelation with human judgments. Existing metrics can be broadly categorized into using n-gram\nmatching, edit distance, embedding matching, or learned functions.\n2.1\nn-GRAM MATCHING APPROACHES\nThe most commonly used metrics for generation count the number of n-grams that occur in the\nreference x and candidate ˆx. The higher the n is, the more the metric is able to capture word order,\nbut it also becomes more restrictive and constrained to the exact form of the reference.\nFormally, let Sn\nx and Sn\nˆx be the lists of token n-grams (n ∈Z+) in the reference x and candidate\nˆx sentences. The number of matched n-grams is P\nw∈Sn\nˆx I[w ∈Sn\nx], where I[·] is an indicator\nfunction. The exact match precision (Exact-Pn) and recall (Exact-Rn) scores are:\nExact-Pn =\nP\nw∈Sn\nˆx I[w ∈Sn\nx]\n|Sn\nˆx|\nand\nExact-Rn =\nP\nw∈Sn\nx I[w ∈Sn\nˆx]\n|Snx|\n.\nSeveral popular metrics build upon one or both of these exact matching scores.\nBLEU\nThe most widely used metric in machine translation is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), which\nincludes three modiﬁcations to Exact-Pn. First, each n-gram in the reference can be matched at\nmost once. Second, the number of exact matches is accumulated for all reference-candidate pairs in\nthe corpus and divided by the total number of n-grams in all candidate sentences. Finally, very short\ncandidates are discouraged using a brevity penalty. Typically, BLEU is computed for multiple values\nof n (e.g. n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and the scores are averaged geometrically. A smoothed variant, SENT-\nBLEU (Koehn et al., 2007) is computed at the sentence level. In contrast to BLEU, BERTSCORE is\nnot restricted to maximum n-gram length, but instead relies on contextualized embeddings that are\nable to capture dependencies of potentially unbounded length.\nMETEOR\nMETEOR (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005) computes Exact-P1 and Exact-R1 while allowing\nbacking-off from exact unigram matching to matching word stems, synonyms, and paraphrases. For\nexample, running may match run if no exact match is possible. Non-exact matching uses an external\nstemmer, a synonym lexicon, and a paraphrase table. METEOR 1.5 (Denkowski & Lavie, 2014)\nweighs content and function words differently, and also applies importance weighting to different\nmatching types. The more recent METEOR++ 2.0 (Guo & Hu, 2019) further incorporates a learned\nexternal paraphrase resource. Because METEOR requires external resources, only ﬁve languages\nare supported with the full feature set, and eleven are partially supported. Similar to METEOR,\nBERTSCORE allows relaxed matches, but relies on BERT embeddings that are trained on large\namounts of raw text and are currently available for 104 languages. BERTSCORE also supports\nimportance weighting, which we estimate with simple corpus statistics.\nOther Related Metrics\nNIST (Doddington, 2002) is a revised version of BLEU that weighs each\nn-gram differently and uses an alternative brevity penalty. ∆BLEU (Galley et al., 2015) modiﬁes\nmulti-reference BLEU by including human annotated negative reference sentences. CHRF (Popovi´c,\n2015) compares character n-grams in the reference and candidate sentences. CHRF++ (Popovi´c,\n2017) extends CHRF to include word bigram matching. ROUGE (Lin, 2004) is a commonly used\nmetric for summarization evaluation. ROUGE-n (Lin, 2004) computes Exact-Rn (usually n = 1, 2),\nwhile ROUGE-L is a variant of Exact-R1 with the numerator replaced by the length of the longest\ncommon subsequence. CIDER (Vedantam et al., 2015) is an image captioning metric that computes\n2\n",

(2018) and Hashimoto et al. (2019) combine automatic metrics\nwith human judgments for text generation evaluation.\n2.2\nEDIT-DISTANCE-BASED METRICS\nSeveral methods use word edit distance or word error rate (Levenshtein, 1966), which quantify\nsimilarity using the number of edit operations required to get from the candidate to the refer-\nence. TER (Snover et al., 2006) normalizes edit distance by the number of reference words, and\nITER (Panja & Naskar, 2018) adds stem matching and better normalization. PER (Tillmann et al.,\n1997) computes position independent error rate, CDER (Leusch et al., 2006) models block reorder-\ning as an edit operation. CHARACTER (Wang et al., 2016) and EED (Stanchev et al., 2019) operate\non the character level and achieve higher correlation with human judgements on some languages.\n2.3\nEMBEDDING-BASED METRICS\nWord embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014; Grave et al., 2018; Nguyen et al.,\n2017; Athiwaratkun et al., 2018) are learned dense token representations. MEANT 2.0 (Lo, 2017)\nuses word embeddings and shallow semantic parses to compute lexical and structural similarity.\nYISI-1 (Lo et al., 2018) is similar to MEANT 2.0, but makes the use of semantic parses optional.\nBoth methods use a relatively simple similarity computation, which inspires our approach, including\nusing greedy matching (Corley & Mihalcea, 2005) and experimenting with a similar importance\nweighting to YISI-1. However, we use contextual embeddings, which capture the speciﬁc use of\na token in a sentence, and potentially capture sequence information. We do not use external tools\nto generate linguistic structures, which makes our approach relatively simple and portable to new\nlanguages. Instead of greedy matching, WMD (Kusner et al., 2015), WMDO (Chow et al., 2019), and\nSMS (Clark et al., 2019) propose to use optimal matching based on earth mover’s distance (Rubner\net al., 1998). The tradeoff1 between greedy and optimal matching was studied by Rus & Lintean\n(2012). Sharma et al. (2018) compute similarity with sentence-level representations. In contrast, our\ntoken-level computation allows us to weigh tokens differently according to their importance.\n2.4\nLEARNED METRICS\nVarious metrics are trained to optimize correlation with human judgments. BEER (Stanojevi´c &\nSima’an, 2014) uses a regression model based on character n-grams and word bigrams. BLEND (Ma\net al., 2017) uses regression to combine 29 existing metrics. RUSE (Shimanaka et al., 2018) com-\nbines three pre-trained sentence embedding models. All these methods require costly human judg-\nments as supervision for each dataset, and risk poor generalization to new domains, even within a\nknown language and task (Chaganty et al., 2018). Cui et al. (2018) and Lowe et al. (2017) train a\nneural model to predict if the input text is human-generated. This approach also has the risk of being\noptimized to existing data and generalizing poorly to new data. In contrast, the model underlying\nBERTSCORE is not optimized for any speciﬁc evaluation task.\n3\nBERTSCORE\nGiven a reference sentence x = ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩and a candidate sentence ˆx = ⟨ˆx1, . . . , ˆxl⟩, we use\ncontextual embeddings to represent the tokens, and compute matching using cosine similarity, op-\ntionally weighted with inverse document frequency scores. Figure 1 illustrates the computation.\nToken Representation\nWe use contextual embeddings to represent the tokens in the input sen-\ntences x and ˆx. In contrast to prior word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\n2014), contextual embeddings, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and ELMO (Peters et al., 2018),\ncan generate different vector representations for the same word in different sentences depending on\nthe surrounding words, which form the context of the target word. The models used to generate\nthese embeddings are most commonly trained using various language modeling objectives, such as\nmasked word prediction (Devlin et al., 2019).\n1We provide an ablation study of this design choice in Appendix C.\n3\n",

Given the reference x and\ncandidate ˆx, we compute BERT embeddings and pairwise cosine similarity. We highlight the greedy\nmatching in red, and include the optional idf importance weighting.\nWe experiment with different models (Section 4), using the tokenizer provided with each model.\nGiven a tokenized reference sentence x = ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩, the embedding model generates a se-\nquence of vectors ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩. Similarly, the tokenized candidate ˆx = ⟨ˆx1, . . . , ˆxm⟩is mapped\nto ⟨ˆx1, . . . , ˆxl⟩. The main model we use is BERT, which tokenizes the input text into a sequence\nof word pieces (Wu et al., 2016), where unknown words are split into several commonly observed\nsequences of characters. The representation for each word piece is computed with a Transformer\nencoder (Vaswani et al., 2017) by repeatedly applying self-attention and nonlinear transformations\nin an alternating fashion. BERT embeddings have been shown to beneﬁt various NLP tasks (Devlin\net al., 2019; Liu, 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019a).\nSimilarity Measure\nThe vector representation allows for a soft measure of similarity instead of\nexact-string (Papineni et al., 2002) or heuristic (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005) matching. The cosine\nsimilarity of a reference token xi and a candidate token ˆxj is\nx⊤\ni ˆxj\n∥xi∥∥ˆxj∥. We use pre-normalized\nvectors, which reduces this calculation to the inner product x⊤\ni ˆxj. While this measure considers\ntokens in isolation, the contextual embeddings contain information from the rest of the sentence.\nBERTSCORE\nThe complete score matches each token in x to a token in ˆx to compute recall,\nand each token in ˆx to a token in x to compute precision. We use greedy matching to maximize\nthe matching similarity score,2 where each token is matched to the most similar token in the other\nsentence. We combine precision and recall to compute an F1 measure. For a reference x and\ncandidate ˆx, the recall, precision, and F1 scores are:\nRBERT = 1\n|x|\nX\nxi∈x\nmax\nˆxj∈ˆx x⊤\ni ˆxj ,\nPBERT = 1\n|ˆx|\nX\nˆxj∈ˆx\nmax\nxi∈x x⊤\ni ˆxj ,\nFBERT = 2 PBERT · RBERT\nPBERT + RBERT\n.\nImportance Weighting\nPrevious work on similarity measures demonstrated that rare words can\nbe more indicative for sentence similarity than common words (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005; Vedantam\net al., 2015). BERTSCORE enables us to easily incorporate importance weighting. We experiment\nwith inverse document frequency (idf) scores computed from the test corpus. Given M reference\nsentences {x(i)}M\ni=1, the idf score of a word-piece token w is\nidf(w) = −log 1\nM\nM\nX\ni=1\nI[w ∈x(i)] ,\nwhere I[·] is an indicator function. We do not use the full tf-idf measure because we process single\nsentences, where the term frequency (tf) is likely 1. For example, recall with idf weighting is\nRBERT =\nP\nxi∈x idf(xi) maxˆxj∈ˆx x⊤\ni ˆxj\nP\nxi∈x idf(xi)\n.\nBecause we use reference sentences to compute idf, the idf scores remain the same for all systems\nevaluated on a speciﬁc test set. We apply plus-one smoothing to handle unknown word pieces.\n2We compare greedy matching with optimal assignment in Appendix C.\n4\n",
  "5": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020\nBaseline Rescaling\nBecause we use pre-normalized vectors, our computed scores have the same\nnumerical range of cosine similarity (between −1 and 1). However, in practice we observe scores\nin a more limited range, potentially because of the learned geometry of contextual embeddings.\nWhile this characteristic does not impact BERTSCORE’s capability to rank text generation systems,\nit makes the actual score less readable. We address this by rescaling BERTSCORE with respect\nto its empirical lower bound b as a baseline. We compute b using Common Crawl monolingual\ndatasets.3 For each language and contextual embedding model, we create 1M candidate-reference\npairs by grouping two random sentences. Because of the random pairing and the corpus diversity,\neach pair has very low lexical and semantic overlapping.4 We compute b by averaging BERTSCORE\ncomputed on these sentence pairs. Equipped with baseline b, we rescale BERTSCORE linearly. For\nexample, the rescaled value ˆRBERT of RBERT is:\nˆRBERT = RBERT −b\n1 −b\n.\nAfter this operation ˆRBERT is typically between 0 and 1. We apply the same rescaling procedure\nfor PBERT and FBERT. This method does not affect the ranking ability and human correlation of\nBERTSCORE, and is intended solely to increase the score readability.\n4\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nWe evaluate our approach on machine translation and image captioning.\nContextual Embedding Models\nWe evaluate twelve pre-trained contextual embedding models,\nincluding variants of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), XLNet (Yang et al.,\n2019b), and XLM (Lample & Conneau, 2019). We present the best-performing models in Section 5.\nWe use the 24-layer RoBERTalarge model5 for English tasks, 12-layer BERTchinese model for Chi-\nnese tasks, and the 12-layer cased multilingual BERTmulti model for other languages.6 We show the\nperformance of all other models in Appendix F. Contextual embedding models generate embedding\nrepresentations at every layer in the encoder network. Past work has shown that intermediate layers\nproduce more effective representations for semantic tasks (Liu et al., 2019a). We use the WMT16\ndataset (Bojar et al., 2016) as a validation set to select the best layer of each model (Appendix B).\nMachine Translation\nOur main evaluation corpus is the WMT18 metric evaluation dataset (Ma\net al., 2018), which contains predictions of 149 translation systems across 14 language pairs, gold\nreferences, and two types of human judgment scores. Segment-level human judgments assign a score\nto each reference-candidate pair. System-level human judgments associate each system with a single\nscore based on all pairs in the test set. WMT18 includes translations from English to Czech, German,\nEstonian, Finnish, Russian, and Turkish, and from the same set of languages to English. We follow\nthe WMT18 standard practice and use absolute Pearson correlation |ρ| and Kendall rank correlation\nτ to evaluate metric quality, and compute signiﬁcance with the Williams test (Williams, 1959) for |ρ|\nand bootstrap re-sampling for τ as suggested by Graham & Baldwin (2014). We compute system-\nlevel scores by averaging BERTSCORE for every reference-candidate pair. We also experiment with\nhybrid systems by randomly sampling one candidate sentence from one of the available systems for\neach reference sentence (Graham & Liu, 2016). This enables system-level experiments with a higher\nnumber of systems. Human judgments of each hybrid system are created by averaging the WMT18\nsegment-level human judgments for the corresponding sentences in the sampled data. We compare\nBERTSCOREs to one canonical metric for each category introduced in Section 2, and include the\ncomparison with all other participating metrics from WMT18 in Appendix F.\nIn addition to the standard evaluation, we design model selection experiments. We use 10K hybrid\nsystems super-sampled from WMT18. We randomly select 100 out of 10K hybrid systems, and rank\nthem using the automatic metrics. We repeat this process 100K times. We report the percentage of\nthe metric ranking agreeing with the human ranking on the best system (Hits@1). In Tables 23-28,\n3https://commoncrawl.org/\n4BLEU computed on these pairs is around zero.\n5We use the tokenizer provided with each model. For all Hugging Face models that use the GPT-2 tokenizer,\nat the time of our experiments, the tokenizer adds a space to the beginning of each sentence.\n6All the models used are from https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers.\n5\n",

Each participating system generates a caption for each image in the\nCOCO validation set (Lin et al., 2014), and each image has approximately ﬁve reference cap-\ntions.\nFollowing Cui et al. (2018), we compute the Pearson correlation with two system-level\nmetrics: the percentage of captions that are evaluated as better or equal to human captions (M1)\nand the percentage of captions that are indistinguishable from human captions (M2). We compute\nBERTSCORE with multiple references by scoring the candidate with each available reference and\nreturning the highest score. We compare with eight task-agnostic metrics: BLEU (Papineni et al.,\n2002), METEOR (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005), ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), CIDER (Vedantam et al., 2015),\nBEER (Stanojevi´c & Sima’an, 2014), EED (Stanchev et al., 2019), CHRF++ (Popovi´c, 2017), and\nCHARACTER (Wang et al., 2016). We also compare with two task-speciﬁc metrics: SPICE (Ander-\nson et al., 2016) and LEIC (Cui et al., 2018).

We bold corre-\nlations of metrics not signiﬁcantly outperformed by any other metric under bootstrap sampling for\nthat language pair and direction. The numbers in parenthesis are the number of candidate-reference\nsentence pairs for each language pair and direction.\n5\nRESULTS\nMachine Translation\nTables 1–3 show system-level correlation to human judgements, correla-\ntions on hybrid systems, and model selection performance. We observe that BERTSCORE is con-\nsistently a top performer. In to-English results, RUSE (Shimanaka et al., 2018) shows competitive\nperformance. However, RUSE is a supervised method trained on WMT16 and WMT15 human\njudgment data. In cases where RUSE models were not made available, such as for our from-English\nexperiments, it is not possible to use RUSE without additional data and training. Table 4 shows\nsegment-level correlations. We see that BERTSCORE exhibits signiﬁcantly higher performance\ncompared to the other metrics. The large improvement over BLEU stands out, making BERTSCORE\nparticularly suitable to analyze speciﬁc examples, where SENTBLEU is less reliable. In Appendix A,\nwe provide qualitative examples to illustrate the segment-level performance difference between\nSENTBLEU and BERTSCORE. At the segment-level, BERTSCORE even signiﬁcantly outperforms\nRUSE. Overall, we ﬁnd that applying importance weighting using idf at times provides small bene-\nﬁt, but in other cases does not help. Understanding better when such importance weighting is likely\nto help is an important direction for future work, and likely depends on the domain of the text and\nthe available test data. We continue without idf weighting for the rest of our experiments. While\nrecall RBERT, precision PBERT, and F1 FBERT alternate as the best measure in different setting, F1\nFBERT performs reliably well across all the different settings. Our overall recommendation is there-\nfore to use F1. We present additional results using the full set of 351 systems and evaluation metrics\nin Tables 12–28 in the appendix, including for experiments with idf importance weighting, different\ncontextual embedding models, and model selection.\nImage Captioning\nTable 5 shows correlation results for the COCO Captioning Challenge.\nBERTSCORE outperforms all task-agnostic baselines by large margins. Image captioning presents a\nchallenging evaluation scenario, and metrics based on strict n-gram matching, including BLEU and\nROUGE, show weak correlations with human judgments. idf importance weighting shows signiﬁ-\n7\n",

Finally,\nLEIC (Cui et al., 2018), a trained metric that takes images as additional inputs and is optimized\nspeciﬁcally for the COCO data and this set of systems, outperforms all other methods.\nSpeed\nDespite the use of a large pre-trained model, computing BERTSCORE is relatively fast. We\nare able to process 192.5 candidate-reference pairs/second using a GTX-1080Ti GPU. The complete\nWMT18 en-de test set, which includes 2,998 sentences, takes 15.6sec to process, compared to 5.4sec\nwith SacreBLEU (Post, 2018), a common BLEU implementation. Given the sizes of commonly used\ntest and validation sets, the increase in processing time is relatively marginal, and BERTSCORE is\na good ﬁt for using during validation (e.g., for stopping) and testing, especially when compared to\nthe time costs of other development stages.\n6\nROBUSTNESS ANALYSIS\nWe test the robustness of BERTSCORE using adversarial paraphrase classiﬁcation. We use the\nQuora Question Pair corpus (QQP; Iyer et al., 2017) and the adversarial paraphrases from the Para-\nphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling dataset (PAWS; Zhang et al., 2019). Both datasets con-\ntain pairs of sentences labeled to indicate whether they are paraphrases or not. Positive examples\nin QQP are real duplicate questions, while negative examples are related, but different questions.\nSentence pairs in PAWS are generated through word swapping. For example, in PAWS, Flights from\nNew York to Florida may be changed to Flights from Florida to New York and a good classiﬁer\nshould identify that these two sentences are not paraphrases. PAWS includes two parts: PAWSQQP,\nwhich is based on the QQP data, and PAWSWiki. We use the PAWSQQP development set which\ncontains 667 sentences. For the automatic metrics, we use no paraphrase detection training data.\nWe expect that pairs with higher scores are more likely to be paraphrases. To evaluate the automatic\nmetrics on QQA, we use the ﬁrst 5,000 sentences in the training set instead of the the test set because\nthe test labels are not available. We treat the ﬁrst sentence as the reference and the second sentence\nas the candidate.\nTable 6 reports the area under ROC curve (AUC) for existing models and automatic metrics. We\nobserve that supervised classiﬁers trained on QQP perform worse than random guess on PAWSQQP,\nwhich shows these models predict the adversarial examples are more likely to be paraphrases. When\n8\n",

Most metrics have decent performance on\nQQP, but show a signiﬁcant performance drop on PAWSQQP, almost down to chance performance.\nThis suggests these metrics fail to to distinguish the harder adversarial examples. In contrast, the\nperformance of BERTSCORE drops only slightly, showing more robustness than the other metrics.\n7\nDISCUSSION\nWe propose BERTSCORE, a new metric for evaluating generated text against gold standard refer-\nences. BERTSCORE is purposely designed to be simple, task agnostic, and easy to use. Our analysis\nillustrates how BERTSCORE resolves some of the limitations of commonly used metrics, especially\non challenging adversarial examples. We conduct extensive experiments with various conﬁguration\nchoices for BERTSCORE, including the contextual embedding model used and the use of impor-\ntance weighting. Overall, our extensive experiments, including the ones in the appendix, show that\nBERTSCORE achieves better correlation than common metrics, and is effective for model selec-\ntion. However, there is no one conﬁguration of BERTSCORE that clearly outperforms all others.\nWhile the differences between the top conﬁgurations are often small, it is important for the user to\nbe aware of the different trade-offs, and consider the domain and languages when selecting the exact\nconﬁguration to use. In general, for machine translation evaluation, we suggest using FBERT, which\nwe ﬁnd the most reliable. For evaluating text generation in English, we recommend using the 24-\nlayer RoBERTalarge model to compute BERTSCORE. For non-English language, the multilingual\nBERTmulti is a suitable choice although BERTSCORE computed with this model has less stable\nperformance on low-resource languages. We report the optimal hyperparameter for all models we\nexperimented with in Appendix B\nBrieﬂy following our initial preprint publication, Zhao et al. (2019) published a concurrently devel-\noped method related to ours, but with a focus on integrating contextual word embeddings with earth\nmover’s distance (EMD; Rubner et al., 1998) rather than our simple matching process. They also\npropose various improvements compared to our use of contextualized embeddings. We study these\nimprovements in Appendix C and show that integrating them into BERTSCORE makes it equivalent\nor better than the EMD-based approach. Largely though, the effect of the different improvements\non BERTSCORE is more modest compared to their method. Shortly after our initial publication,\nYiSi-1 was updated to use BERT embeddings, showing improved performance (Lo, 2019). This\nfurther corroborates our ﬁndings. Other recent related work includes training a model on top of\nBERT to maximize the correlation with human judgments (Mathur et al., 2019) and evaluating gen-\neration with a BERT model ﬁne-tuned on paraphrasing (Yoshimura et al., 2019). More recent work\nshows the potential of using BERTSCORE for training a summarization system (Li et al., 2019)\nand for domain-speciﬁc evaluation using SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019) to evaluate abstractive text\nsummarization (Gabriel et al., 2019).\nIn future work, we look forward to designing new task-speciﬁc metrics that use BERTSCORE as a\nsubroutine and accommodate task-speciﬁc needs, similar to how Wieting et al. (2019) suggests to use\nsemantic similarity for machine translation training. Because BERTSCORE is fully differentiable,\nit also can be incorporated into a training procedure to compute a learning loss that reduces the\nmismatch between optimization and evaluation objectives.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis research is supported in part by grants from the National Science Foundation (III-1618134, III-\n1526012, IIS1149882, IIS-1724282, TRIPODS-1740822, CAREER-1750499), the Ofﬁce of Naval\nResearch DOD (N00014-17-1-2175), and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, SAP, Zillow,\nWorkday, and Facebook Research.

Rankings assigned by Human, FBERT, and BLEU are shown in the right three\ncolumns. The sentences are ranked by the similarity, i.e. rank 1 is the most similar pair assigned by\na score. An ideal metric should rank similar to humans.\nA\nQUALITATIVE ANALYSIS\nWe study BERTSCORE and SENTBLEU using WMT16 German-to-English (Bojar et al., 2016). We\nrank all 560 candidate-reference pairs by human score, BERTSCORE, or SENTBLEU from most\nsimilar to least similar. Ideally, the ranking assigned by BERTSCORE and SENTBLEU should be\nsimilar to the ranking assigned by the human score.\nTable 7 ﬁrst shows examples where BERTSCORE and SENTBLEU scores disagree about the ranking\nfor a candidate-reference pair by a large number. We observe that BERTSCORE is effectively able\nto capture synonyms and changes in word order. For example, the reference and candidate sentences\nin pair 3 are almost identical except that the candidate replaces opinion in Hungary with Hungarian\nview and switches the order of the quotation mark (“) and a. While BERTSCORE ranks the pair\nrelatively high, SENTBLEU judges the pair as dissimilar, because it cannot match synonyms and is\nsensitive to the small word order changes. Pair 5 shows a set of changes that preserve the semantic\nmeaning: replacing to cut with will reduce and swapping the order of 30,000 and jobs. BERTSCORE\nranks the candidate translation similar to the human judgment, whereas SENTBLEU ranks it much\nlower. We also see that SENTBLEU potentially over-rewards n-gram overlap, even when phrases\nare used very differently. In pair 6, both the candidate and the reference contain the human dignity\nof the man. Yet the two sentences convey very different meaning. BERTSCORE agrees with the\nhuman judgment and ranks the pair low. In contrast, SENTBLEU considers the pair as relatively\nsimilar because of the signiﬁcant word overlap.\n15\n",

The cosine similarity of each word matching in PBERT are\ncolor-coded.\nThe bottom half of Table 7 shows examples where BERTSCORE and human judgments disagree\nabout the ranking. We observe that BERTSCORE ﬁnds it difﬁcult to detect factual errors. For\nexample, BERTSCORE assigns high similarity to pair 11 when the translation replaces German\nlanguage with English and pair 12 where the translation incorrectly outputs Tuesday when it is\nsupposed to generate Monday. BERTSCORE also fails to identify that 5ft 11in is equivalent with\n1.80 metres in pair 18. As a result, BERTSCORE assigns low similarity to the eighth pair in Table 7.\nSENTBLEU also suffers from these limitations.\nFigure 2 visualizes the BERTSCORE matching of two pairs of candidate and reference sentences.\nThe ﬁgure illustrates how FBERT matches synonymous phrases, such as imported cars and foreign\ncars.

In designing\nBERTSCORE, we use WMT16 segment-level human judgment data as a development set to fa-\ncilitate our representation choice. For Chinese models, we tune with the WMT17 “en-zh” data\nbecause the language pair “en-zh” is not available in WMT16. In Figure 3, we plot the change of\nhuman correlation of FBERT over different layers of BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet and XLM models.\nBased on results from different models, we identify a common trend that FBERT computed with the\nintermediate representations tends to work better.

  "19": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020\nC\nABLATION STUDY OF MOVERSCORE\nWord Mover’s Distance (WMD; Kusner et al., 2015) is a semantic similarity metric that relies on\nword embeddings and optimal transport. MOVERSCORE (Zhao et al., 2019) combines contextual\nembeddings and WMD for text generation evaluation. In contrast, BERTSCORE adopts a greedy\napproach to aggregate token-level information. In addition to using WMD for generation evalu-\nation, Zhao et al. (2019) also introduce various other improvements. We do a detailed ablation\nstudy to understand the beneﬁt of each improvement, and to investigate whether it can be applied to\nBERTSCORE. We use a 12-layer uncased BERT model on the WMT17 to-English segment-level\ndata, the same setting as Zhao et al. (2019).\nWe identify several differences between MOVERSCORE and BERTSCORE by analyzing the released\nsource code. We isolate each difference, and mark it with a bracketed tag for our ablation study:\n1. [MNLI] Use a BERT model ﬁne-tuned on MNLI (Williams et al., 2018).\n2. [PMEANS] Apply power means (Rücklé et al., 2018) to aggregate the information of dif-\nferent layers.9\n3. [IDF-L] For reference sentences, instead of computing the idf scores on the 560 sen-\ntences in the segment-level data ([IDF-S]), compute the idf scores on the 3,005 sentences\nin the system-level data.\n4. [SEP] For candidate sentences, recompute the idf scores on the candidate sentences. The\nweighting of reference tokens are kept the same as in [IDF-S]\n5. [RM] Exclude punctuation marks and sub-word tokens except the ﬁrst sub-word in each\nword from the matching.\nWe follow the setup of Zhao et al. (2019) and use their released ﬁne-tuned BERT model to\nconduct the experiments.\nTable 9 shows the results of our ablation study.\nWe report corre-\nlations for the two variants of WMD Zhao et al. (2019) study:\nunigrams (WMD1) and bi-\ngrams (WMD2). Our FBERT corresponds to the vanilla setting and the importance weighted vari-\nant corresponds to the [IDF-S] setting.\nThe complete MOVERSCORE metric corresponds to\n[IDF-S]+[SEP]+[PMEANS]+[MNLI]+[RM]. We make several observations. First, for all lan-\nguage pairs except ﬁ-en and lv-en, we can replicate the reported performance. For these two lan-\nguage pairs, Zhao et al. (2019) did not release their implementations at the time of publication.10\nSecond, we conﬁrm the effectiveness of [PMEANS] and [MNLI]. In Appendix F, we study more\npre-trained models and further corroborate this conclusion. However, the contribution of other tech-\nniques, including [RM] and [SEP], seems less stable. Third, replacing greedy matching with\nWMD does not lead to consistent improvement. In fact, oftentimes BERTSCORE is the better met-\nric when given the same setup. In general, for any given language pair, BERTSCORE is always\namong the best performing ones. Given the current results, it is not clear tht WMD is better than\ngreedy matching for text generation evaluation.\n9 Zhao et al. (2019) uses the embeddings from the last ﬁve layers from BERT and L2-normalizes the embed-\nding vectors at each layer before computing the P-MEANs and L2-normalizing the concatenated P-MEANS.\n10A public comment on the project page indicates that some of the techniques are not applied for these two\nlanguage pairs (https://github.com/AIPHES/emnlp19-moverscore/issues/1).\n19\n",

(2019b) introduce RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT ap-\nproach) and demonstrate that an optimized BERT model is comparable to or sometimes outperforms\nan XLNet on downstream tasks.\nWe perform a comprehensive study with the following pre-trained contextual embedding models:15\n• BERT\nmodels:\nbert-base-uncased,\nbert-large-uncased,\nbert-based-chinese,\nbert-base-multilingual-cased,\nand\nbert-base-cased-mrpc\n• RoBERTa models: roberta-base, roberta-large, and roberta-large-mnli\n• XLNet models: xlnet-base-cased and xlnet-base-large\n• XLM models: xlm-mlm-en-2048 and xlm-mlm-100-1280\nF.1\nWMT CORRELATION STUDY\nExperimental setup\nBecause of missing data in the released WMT16 dataset (Bojar et al., 2016),\nwe are only able to experiment with to-English segment-level data, which contains the outputs of\n50 different systems on 6 language pairs. We use this data as the validation set for hyperparam-\neter tuning (Appendix B). Table 12 shows the Pearson correlations of all participating metrics and\nBERTSCOREs computed with different pre-trained models. Signiﬁcance testing for this dataset does\nnot include the baseline metrics because the released dataset does not contain the original outputs\nfrom the baseline metrics. We conduct signiﬁcance testing between BERTSCORE results only.\nThe WMT17 dataset (Bojar et al., 2017) contains outputs of 152 different translations on 14 lan-\nguage pairs. We experiment on the segment-level and system-level data on both to-English and\nfrom-English language pairs. We exclude ﬁ-en data from the segment-level experiment due to an\nerror in the released data. We compare our results to all participating metrics and perform standard\nsigniﬁcance testing as done by Bojar et al. (2017). Tables 13–16 show the results.\nThe WMT18 dataset (Ma et al., 2018) contains outputs of 159 translation systems on 14 lan-\nguage pairs. In addition to the results in Tables 1–4, we complement the study with the correla-\ntions of all participating metrics in WMT18 and results from using different contextual models for\nBERTSCORE.\nResults\nTable 12–22 collectively showcase the effectiveness of BERTSCORE in correlating with\nhuman judgments. The improvement of BERTSCORE is more pronounced on the segment-level\nthan on the system-level. We also see that more optimized or larger BERT models can produce better\ncontextual representations (e.g., comparing FRoBERTa–Large and FBERT–Large). In contrast, the smaller\nXLNet performs better than a large one. Based on the evidence in Figure 8 and Tables 12–22, we\n15Denoted by names speciﬁed at https://huggingface.co/pytorch-transformers/pretrained_models.html.\n23\n",

We also observe that ﬁne-tuning pre-trained models on a related task,\nsuch as natural language inference (Williams et al., 2018), can lead to better human correlation in\nevaluating text generation. Therefore, for evaluating English sentences, we recommend computing\nBERTSCORE with a 24-layer RoBERTa model ﬁne-tuned on the MNLI dataset. For evaluating\nNon-English sentences, both the multilingual BERT model and the XLM model trained on 100\nlanguages are suitable candidates. We also recommend using domain- or language-speciﬁc contex-\ntual embeddings when possible, such as using BERT Chinese models for evaluating Chinese tasks.\nIn general, we advise users to consider the target domain and languages when selecting the exact\nconﬁguration to use.\nF.2\nMODEL SELECTION STUDY\nExperimental setup\nSimilar to Section 4, we use the 10K hybrid systems super-sampled from\nWMT18. We randomly select 100 out of 10K hybrid systems, rank them using automatic metrics,\nand repeat this process 100K times. We add to the results in the main paper (Table 3) performance of\nall participating metrics in WMT18 and results from using different contextual embedding models\nfor BERTSCORE. We reuse the hybrid conﬁguration and metric outputs released in WMT18. In\naddition to the Hits@1 measure, we evaluate the metrics using (a) mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of\nthe top metric-rated system in human rankings, and (b) the absolute human score difference (Diff)\nbetween the top metric- and human-rated systems. Hits@1 captures a metric’s ability to select the\nbest system. The other two measures quantify the amount of error a metric makes in the selection\nprocess. Tables 23–28 show the results from these experiments.\nResults\nThe additional results further support our conclusion from Table 3: BERTSCORE demon-\nstrates better model selection performance. We also observe that the supervised metric RUSE dis-\nplays strong model selection ability.\nF.3\nIMAGE CAPTIONING ON COCO\nWe follow the experimental setup described in Section 4. Table 29 shows the correlations of several\npre-trained contextual embeddings. We observe that precision-based methods such as BLEU and\nPBERT are weakly correlated with human judgments on image captioning tasks. We hypothesize\nthat this is because human judges prefer captions that capture the main objects in a picture for\nimage captioning. In general, RBERT has a high correlation, even surpassing the task-speciﬁc metric\nSPICE Anderson et al. (2016). While the ﬁne-tuned RoBERTa-Large model does not result in the\nhighest correlation, it is one of the best metrics.\nF.4\nROBUSTNESS ANALYSIS ON PAWS-QQP\nWe present the full results of the robustness study described in Section 6 in Table 30. In general,\nwe observe that BERTSCORE is more robust than other commonly used metrics. BERTSCORE\ncomputed with the 24-layer RoBERTa model performs the best. Fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large on\nMNLI (Williams et al., 2018) can signiﬁcantly improve the robustness against adversarial sentences.\nHowever, a ﬁne-tuned BERT on MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrasing Corpus) (Dolan & Brock-\nett, 2005) performs worse than its counterpart.\n24\n",
