  "1": "Language Models Predict Empathy Gaps\nBetween Social In-groups and Out-groups\nYu Hou\nHal Daumé III\nRachel Rudinger\nUniversity of Maryland\n{houyu,hal3,rudinger}@umd.edu\nAbstract\nStudies of human psychology have demon-\nstrated that people are more motivated to extend\nempathy to in-group members than out-group\nmembers (Cikara et al., 2011). In this study,\nwe investigate how this aspect of intergroup\nrelations in humans is replicated by LLMs in\nan emotion intensity prediction task. In this\ntask, the LLM is given a short description of\nan experience a person had that caused them\nto feel a particular emotion; the LLM is then\nprompted to predict the intensity of the emo-\ntion the person experienced on a numerical\nscale. By manipulating the group identities as-\nsigned to the LLM’s persona (the “perceiver”)\nand the person in the narrative (the “experi-\nencer”), we measure how predicted emotion in-\ntensities differ between in-group and out-group\nsettings. We observe that LLMs assign higher\nemotion intensity scores to in-group members\nthan out-group members. This pattern holds\nacross all three types of social groupings we\ntested: race/ethnicity, nationality, and religion.\nWe perform an in-depth analysis on Llama-3.1-\n8B, the model which exhibited strongest inter-\ngroup bias among those tested.1\n1\nIntroduction\n“People are often motivated to increase others’\npositive experiences and to alleviate others’ suf-\nfering ... When the target is an outgroup member,\nhowever, people may have powerful motivations\nnot to care about or help that “other”.”\n—- Cikara et al. (2011)\nAs language technologies play an increasingly im-\nportant role in interpersonal communication in so-\nciety, research has shown that their use can im-\npact social relationships (Hohenstein et al., 2023).\nThis could potentially occur when communication\npartners perceive one another differently through\ntheir use of suggestions from assistant tools (e.g.\nChatGPT). This impact on social relationships can\n1Code and data can be found at https://github.com/\nhouyu0930/intergroup-empathy-bias.\n…\n…\n…\n…\nFigure 1: Task setup with in-group and out-group exam-\nples. We introduce Æ perceiver and   experiencer\nroles to define the intergroup relationship, where it is\nin-group when they are from the same social group. The\nperceiver is modeled by the LLM persona and the expe-\nriencer is specified in the task context. Each role falls\ninto one of the race or ethnicity, nationality, and religion\ncategories. The social group is specified with identity\nnames under the category. We replace the identities of\nperceiver and experiencer to study intergroup bias.\nbe exacerbated because people are cognitive mis-\ners (Fiske, 1991; Stanovich, 2009) and prefer to\nmake judgements that require less mental effort.\nThese cognitive shortcuts often mean relying on\nstereotypes which can eventually lead to intergroup\nprejudice (Schaller and Neuberg, 2008).\nIn psychology, the intergroup process—how peo-\nple perceive and interact with others who are mem-\nbers of the same group (in-group) or members of\na different group (out-group)—has been widely\nstudied. Research shows that people view social\nin-group and out-group members with different em-\npathic feelings and emotional intensities (Cikara\net al., 2011; Zaki and Cikara, 2015; Brewer, 1999;\nCikara et al., 2014; Kommattam et al., 2019), and\nthis behavior further shapes the intergroup rela-\ntions (Vanman, 2016).\nFor example, a person\nmight feel more warm and act more friendly to-\nward another person from their home country, but\nact indifferently—or similarly with less intensity—\narXiv:2503.01030v1  [cs.CL]  2 Mar 2025\n",
  "2": "toward a person from another nation. Appropriately\naddressing empathic failures helps reduce conflicts\nbetween groups and reduce out-group discrimina-\ntion (Cikara et al., 2011; Zaki and Cikara, 2015).\nIn this paper, we study intergroup bias in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by asking: Do LLMs\nreflect human-like empathy gaps between social\nin-groups and out-groups? To test the question, we\nformulate an emotion intensity prediction task,2 as\nshown in Figure 1. In this task, we simulate a sce-\nnario in which the LLM’s assigned persona (“the\nperceiver”) reads a short narrative of an experience\nthat a person (“the experiencer”) had which caused\nthem to feel a particular emotion; the perceiver\n(LLM) is then prompted to predict the intensity of\nthe emotion felt by the experiencer on a numerical\nscale. To compare in-group and out-group empa-\nthy, we manipulate the LLM inputs to assign the\nperceiver and experiencer a social group identity\nbased on either race/ethnicity, nationality, or reli-\ngion. We compare the predicted intensities when\nthe perceiver and experiencer belong to the same\nsocial group (in-group) or different social groups\n(out-group), finding higher average intensities in\nthe former. To illustrate, consider the scenario in\nFigure 1: I felt sad when I received job rejections,\nwhere “I” refers to the experiencer. The LLM’s\npersona, a white perceiver, predicts a higher degree\nof sadness for a white experiencer than for a black\nexperiencer in the identical scenario.\nWhile many papers have studied stereotypes and\nharms with language models, they typically con-\nsider the task from a single perspective of either\nhow these models perceive other groups through\ntheir representations (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Dev\net al., 2019; Cao et al., 2022, 2024; Sheng et al.,\n2019; Cheng et al., 2023), or in downstream tasks\nhow they are biased towards target groups (Wan\net al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023; Deshpande et al.,\n2023; Gupta et al., 2024a; An et al., 2024; Nghiem\net al., 2024), ignoring the intergroup cases when\nboth the perceiver and target are present. Our work\nbuilds on a few recent studies of intergroup percep-\ntions in LLMs (Govindarajan et al., 2023a,b, 2024),\nwhich focus on relationships in politics or in sports.\nOur primary contributions and findings are: (1)\nWe study intergroup empathy bias with respect to\ngroup identities rooted in race/ethnicity, nationality,\n2Empathy is complex and multidimensional, making it dif-\nficult to measure (Lahnala et al., 2025). However, in studying\nthe intergroup empathy gap, intensity bias can serve as a lens,\nas suggested by Kommattam et al. (2019).\nand religion. We study four broad race/ethnicity\ncategories (with 18 corresponding group names),\n21 nationalities, and five religions. (2) We show\nLLMs present in-group and out-group emotion in-\ntensity differences, where Llama-3.1-8B models\nshow significantly higher intensities for in-group\ncases and overall lower intensities for minority\ngroups. (3) We observe the intensities are affected\nby the cultural and historical factors which might\nfurther enlarge the tension between groups.\n2\nBackground and Related Work\nIntergroup Bias.\nPeople live in groups with so-\ncial identities, the self-definition based on social\nroles played in society or memberships of social\ngroups (Priante et al., 2016). Groups naturally form\nand differ as people seek to meet their physical\nneeds (such as resources) or psychological needs\n(such as shared values and a sense of belonging).\nPrejudice between groups arises when an outgroup\nis seen as a threat to the ingroup, whether in terms\nof physical resources or psychological well-being.\nPrejudice might not lead to the direct hostility to-\nward outgroup members, but preferential treatment\nof ingroup members (Brewer, 1999). Ingroup fa-\nvoritism (Everett et al., 2015) further influences\nthe behaviors in charity donations (Winterich et al.,\n2009) and pain perception (Xu et al., 2009; Meconi\net al., 2015; Forgiarini et al., 2011).\nSimilarly, people share and understand other’s\nemotions with empathy, but treat others differently\nbased on identities. Cikara et al. (2014) defines\nIntergroup Empathy Bias as:\n“the tendency not only to empathize less with out-\ngroup relative to in-group members, but also feel\npleasure in response to their pain (and pain in\nresponse to their pleasure)”\nEmpathy failures might introduce intergroup con-\nflicts and discrimination (Cikara et al., 2011;\nZaki and Cikara, 2015; Cikara, 2015; Cikara and\nFiske, 2011). Research on interpersonal relation-\nships (Bucchioni et al., 2015; Schiano Lomoriello\net al., 2018; Ashton et al., 1980) and neurocogni-\ntive understanding (Gutsell and Inzlicht, 2011; Han,\n2018) support the importance of studying this con-\ncept in group contexts (Chiao and Mathur, 2010).\nIn our work, we use perceived emotion intensities\nas a measure of empathy to compare relative levels\nof in-group versus out-group empathy.\nSocial Identity and Persona.\nSocial identities\nhave been studied when users interact with chat-\n",
  "3": "bots (Tanprasert et al., 2024; Joby and Umemuro,\n2022). People react differently due to the target\nidentities with hate speech (Yoder et al., 2022).\nLLMs might thus learn in-group favoritism rep-\nresentations when prompted with “We are” (Hu\net al., 2023). While there are approaches discussing\nthe bias mitigation (Cheng et al., 2022), new chal-\nlenges are introduced with LLMs (Navigli et al.,\n2023). Personas, or fictional identities that LLMs\nhave been instructed to adopt, have been used to\nstudy a variety of social phenomena in LLMs. It\ncan be a way to understand the truthfulness of\nLLMs (Joshi et al., 2024), but possibly lead to\nin-group bias under a multilingual setting (Dong\net al., 2024). In this work, we focus specifically\non intergroup empathy bias as a form of intergroup\nprejudice rooted in social identities that may be\nstudied in LLMs with the use of such personas.\nEmotion in NLP.\nThe development of emotion\nresearch in natural language processing has been\nsummarized with challenges (Plaza-del Arco et al.,\n2024c) and the importance of event-centric emo-\ntion analysis is emphasized (Klinger, 2023). Tasks\non modeling emotions in text are usually catego-\nrized into (1) categorical emotion classification\nwhere models need to return emotion words; (2)\ncontinuous dimensional emotion prediction (e.g.\nvalence, arousal, and dominance); and (3) predic-\ntion with appraisal theories. However, as emotions\nare subjective feelings and highly related to peo-\nple’s past experiences and background (Milkowski\net al., 2021), a task of predicting the intensity for\nspecific emotion categories is introduced to cap-\nture the nuances (Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez,\n2017a,b; Kleinberg et al., 2020), which is adapted\nin our study. On the social bias of emotions side,\nstereotypes with emotion attributes in event-centric\nnarratives for gender (Plaza-del Arco et al., 2024a)\nand religion (Plaza-del Arco et al., 2024b) have\nbeen discussed. To the best of our knowledge, we\nare the first to study the intergroup empathy gap.\n3\nGeneral Methods\nWe construct an emotion intensity prediction task\nto measure the impact of in-groupness and out-\ngroupness on model outputs. Our specific task has\nthe following components: the emotion, the emo-\ntional situation, the social group of the experiencer\n(who is experiencing the emotion), and the social\ngroup of the perceiver (who observes the experi-\nencer). We instruct models to predict the intensity\nof a specific emotion. For example, in Figure 1, the\nmodel needs to predict the intensity of sadness in\na job rejection scenario given variable experiencer\nand perceiver social identities.\n3.1\nSocial Groups\nTo study the intergroup relationships between the\nperceiver and the experiencer, we compile social\ngroups under three categories, namely Race or Eth-\nnicity, Nationality and Religion in Table 1. For\neach group, we have social identity names by con-\nsidering commonly used terms.\nRace or Ethnicity.\nAs race and ethnicity defini-\ntion differs per nation,3 we follow the standard of\nthe US census with 4 social groups: White, Black,\nAsian, and Hispanic. To specify the social group\nof either the perceiver or the experiencer in text,\nwe include identity names with variations for each\ngroup. We consider a total 18 social identity names\nacross these four groups as shown in Table 1.\nNationality.\nWe consider a total of 21 countries\nfrom The World Factbook (2022) following the\napproach of Bhatia et al. (2024) and Wang et al.\n(2024b) to stratify based on geographical region,\npopulation size, and development levels. We adapt\nthe template: a person from {country}, to com-\nmunicate the social group under the nationality\ncategory. In addition, for later analysis, we classify\ncountries based on the Inglehart-Welzel Cultural\nMap (World Values Survey, 2023); see Table 4.\nReligion.\nWe include 5 major religions: Chris-\ntianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism.\n3.2\nCorpus\nTo probe the emotion intensity predictions of\nLLMs, we use the crowd-enVENT (Troiano et al.,\n2023) dataset as the source of experiencer narra-\ntives. Crowd-enVENT follows the approach of the\nInternational Survey On Emotion Antecedents And\nReactions (ISEAR) (Scherer and Wallbott, 1994)\nwhere it collects self-reported events with emotions.\nIt is crowdsourced in English with two parts: gen-\neration and validation; we only consider the gen-\nerations. Participants recall an event for the given\nemotion in a format of: I felt ___ when ___. ,\n3Even in closely-related countries.\nFor example, the\nUnited States defines “Asian\" as individuals with origins in\nany of peoples of Central or East Asia, Southeast Asia, or\nSouth Asia (United States Census Bureau, 2024). Whereas\nthe United Kingdom considers categories like “Asian, Asian\nBritish or Asian Welsh\" (Office for National Statistics, 2023).\n",

For Race or Ethnicity, we\nhave 3-6 identity names for each social group. For Nationality groups (*), only country names are presented here;\nthe identity name of each nationality group follows the template: a person from {country}.\nwhere the first placeholder is for the emotion (e.g.,\nsad) and the second is for their experience (e.g.,\n“received dozens of job rejections”).\nCrowd-enVENT expands the seven emotions\nfrom ISEAR to twelve (anger, disgust, fear, guilt,\nsadness, shame, boredom, joy, pride, trust, relief,\nand surprise) and one no emotion case. There are\n225 events for shame and guilt emotions and 550\nevents for all other cases, resulting in 6600 events.\nWe exclude the no emotion example and use the\nremaining 6050 events as the narratives.\n3.3\nTask Formulation\nGiven the event e ∈E with its reported emotion,\nthe perceiver social identity gp ∈Gperceiver and the\nexperiencer social identity gexp ∈Gexperiencer, the\nemotion intensity task is formulated as:\nI(e,gp,gexp) = LLM\n\u0000mk_prompt(e, gp, gexp)\n\u0001\nwhere I is the predicted emotion intensity. Gperceiver\nand Gexperiencer follow the order in Table 1, plus a\nunspecified group (“a person”) as the reference.\nPrompts.\nOur prompt generator mk_prompt\ntakes as input an event and two social identities\nand produces a prompt that can be used as input to\nan LLM. There are two parts of prompts modeling\nroles: (1) the system prompt, used to specify the\nLLM persona for gp; and (2) the task prompt which\nembeds the social group of the experiencer gexp.\nPrompt template details are in §A.1.\nWe begin by constructing a default prompt set-\nting using the simplest and most natural persona\n(P0): You are ___. , where the blank is the per-\nceiver social identity (e.g. a white person). The\ndefault prediction scale is ranging from 0 to 100\n(S0). The default task instructions are configured\nto directly fill in the narrative with the self-reported\nevents from the crowd-enVENT corpus (T0).\nTo study the generalizability of the results and\nrobustness to prompt variation, we systematically\nvary the prompt from the default setting (P0,\nS0, T0): we replace a single part of the prompt\nwhile holding the other two intact. We draw per-\nsona prompt variations (P1-P3) from Gupta et al.\n(2024b), who instruct LLMs to follow the role\nstrictly in a more explicit way. We vary the system\nprompt S1 to test the influences of a small intensity\nscale range of (0-10) as opposed to (0-100). Lastly,\nas the way of writing might represent divergent\nintensities of feeling, we consider two methods for\nvarying the narrative part of the task instruction. T1\nadds the emotion as part of the narrative, following\nthe format of “I felt ___”. T2 further rewrites\nthe narrative from a third-person perspective. (See\n§A.2 for rewrite setup and details.)\nModels.\nWe experiment with four open-weight\nstate-of-the-art LLMs:\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct,\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct (Llama Team, 2024),\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (Jiang et al., 2023) and\nQwen-2-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024). For each\nLLM, our task setup requires about 37 million infer-\nences.4 Implementation details are in Appendix B.\n3.4\nEvaluation Metrics\nFor any social identity pair (gp, gexp), we take the\naverage of intensities over events to get an aver-\nage intensity for each perceiver-experiencer pair,\nsummarized in a matrix M, where columns are\nperceivers and rows are experiencers. Each row\nor column starts with the unspecified group, fol-\nlowed by the social identities within the category\nin Table 1. Under the race or ethnicity, identities\nare ordered by group: White, Black, Asian, and\nHispanic. Within each group, the sequence follows\n4(19 × 19 Race or Ethnicity + 22 × 22 Nationality + 6 × 6\nReligion) Social Group Pairs × 6050 Events × 7 Prompt\nSettings. We include the unspecified group for each category.\n",

The min values and max\nvalues of each M are in Table 7 (§C.2). We observe that the mean decreases as the standard deviation increases for\nstricter personas (P2 and P3). It is the opposite trend when the origin narrative is rewritten (T1 and T2).\nwith the perceiver in-group identity or experiencer\nin-group identity). We discuss both in detail below.\nRace or ethnicity, nationality and religion\ngroups all show higher predicted intensities for\nin-group pairs.\nFrom the summarized δ in Ta-\nble 2, we see that across almost all groups, prompt\nvariations and LLMs, there is a robust positive\nintergroup gap, with z-scores as much as 3.78.\nThe majority of exceptions to this are with the\nlarger Llama-70B, where, especially for religion,\nwe sometimes see a negative gap (though often\nsmall in magnitude). The average empathy gap\nranges from 0.13 (Llama-70B) to 2.11 (Llama-8B),\nwith Mistral (0.77) and Qwen (1.20) in the middle.\nFor race or ethnicity groups, where we test iden-\ntity name variations for the same social group, in\nLlama-8B models, we consistently observe a clear\nand distinct block-diagonal pattern (Figure 3 and\nthe first row of Figure 2), where a lower gap is\nseen for in-group comparisons than for out-group\ncomparisons. We also see that when the perceiver\nis White, the out-group gap is generally lower; this\nis likely due to a defaulting effect where unspeci-\nfied perceiver is “assumed to be” White (Sun et al.,\n2023). For other models,9 while the deviation is\nsmall, masked cells are mostly in diagonal blocks,\nshowing out-group predictions might follow differ-\nent distributions from in-group pairs.\nPrompt settings influences the intergroup gap.\nWith results of Llama-8B in Figure 2 and Table 3,\nwe observe the effects of prompt variations on\nmodel behaviors from three aspects. First, the\nLLM Persona (P0-P3): In prompts P2 and P3,\nthe model is strongly encouraged (with words like\n“strict” and “critical”) to faithfully follow the per-\nsona, and in these cases, we see that, LLMs show a\nlarger in-group and out-group gap. Other models\nfollow the same with higher σ. Next, Prediction\nScale (S0-S1): Though changing the scale from\n0-100 to 0-10 limits the model’s ability to predict\ndifferences, we see relatively little change across\nthis prompt variant. Finally, Narrative Perspec-\ntive (T0-T2): Reframing the original narratives\n9Results for Mistral, Qwen, and Llama-70B are in §C.2.\n",

The color scheme matches Figure 4 referring\nto the original world cultural map.\nTable 1, to understand if models capture any vari-\nations. Though models don’t seem to capture the\nnuances in social identity names from the block-\nness pattern of Figure 3 at the first glance, four\nsocial groups show divergent results from both row-\nlevel and column-level comparisons. For instance,\nwhite perceivers, as modeled by LLM personas, are\nseemly the most empathetic (darker band of rows at\nthe top), whereas Black perceivers are the least em-\npathetic. In addition to the default assumption in §4,\nas predicted by language models, we are curious to\nask if a group’s relative social power plays a role\non how it will empathize with out-group members\nwith greater or lesser power. From the experiencer\nside, Asians (used in LLM task instructions), seem\nto receive the least amount of empathy (lightest set\nof columns), and Hispanic the most (darkest set of\ncolumns) with the Latina column being the darkest.\nAs “Latina” refers to a female, it is unclear whether\nthis relates to the gender stereotype of women be-\ning prone to emotional excess (Stauffer, 2008).\n",

(2024b).\nGroup pairs with lower intensity.\nSome of the\neffects we see that are outside of the block diag-\nonals can be explained by historical information.\nFor example, in Figure 5 when the perceiver is “a\nperson from Palestine” and the experiencer is “a\nperson from Israel”, the average intensity score\nis the lowest. A similar pattern occurs when the\nperceiver is “a person from Ukraine” and the ex-\nperiencer role is “a person from Russian”. There\nare historical wars and conflicts between Israel and\nPalestine, and between Russia and Ukraine, which\nthe models are likely reflecting in these predictions.\nAs a result, it is worth being extremely cautious\nwhen using LLMs and their personas for intergroup\ncontext to avoid introducing prejudice.\n6\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nOur paper focuses on uncovering social biases\nalong two-axes rather than the more standard\nsingle-axis “disaggregated evaluation” paradigm\nthat has gained significant traction in evaluating\nmodel fairness. We introduce the intergroup frame-\nwork to study the intergroup empathy gap predicted\nby language models.

  "9": "look on Llama-3.1-8B results, we observe models\nrepresent social groups differently with possible\nhistorical factors and cultural effects.\nWith the complex intergroup perceptions in hu-\nman and further learned by language models, it\nis important to think a step further on the poten-\ntial harms. Considering people are relying more\non LLM-mediated communication, the intergroup\nprejudice could negatively impact how people in-\nteract with each other unconsciously.\nThough psychologists propose putting ourselves\nin other people’s shoes can reduce the bias in in-\nterpersonal communication (De Freitas and Cikara,\n2018), it is not clear about the meaning of\n“perspective-taking” when it comes to language\nmodels. We need to study where they learn the in-\ntergroup bias so we can intervene the downstream\ndecision-making tasks such as hiring (Heitlinger\net al., 2022). However, we don’t mean the inter-\ngroup empathy gap always brings harms. People\ntreat others differently based on the social group\nmemberships with meanings. It can help in-group\ncohesion and live a fulfilling life with enough re-\nsources and physiological support. Moreover, in-\ndividuals from underrepresented groups may al-\nready face discrimination from dominant groups,\nand addressing the empathy gap in communication\nwithout care could potentially exacerbate existing\npower imbalances. We hope our community can be\nmore aware of intergroup bias while pursing more\nintelligent general AI systems.\nLimitations\nDataset.\nWe use the crowd-enVENT corpus for\nall experiments. While it collects data more re-\ncently with broader emotion type coverage, we\nignore the narrative effects on intergroup atti-\ntudes (Cachón and Igartua, 2016). As certain events\nmay be culturally exclusive and evoke specific emo-\ntions, future research can use the same intergroup\nsetup with different datasets to study the influence.\nComplex Social Identities.\nWe only consider\nthree categories of social groups and simplify how\npeople self-identify themselves. It is well-known\nsocial identities are complex from social psychol-\nogy (Marsden and Pröbster, 2019). For example,\npeople may have multiple identities, such as Ko-\nrean American or Chinese American, in addition\nto identifying as Asian. The way they use these\nidentities conveys different implicit information,\nwhich is also the case for multi-racial individuals.\nGroups involving multiple categories have also not\nbeen studied. It is common for a person to identify\nwith both racial and national groups.\nModels and Prompts.\nDue to the computing re-\nsource limitations and costs, we only consider four\npopular open-weight large language models for re-\nproducibility. Researchers interested in this topic\ncan extend the setup to more models, e.g. Chat-\nGPT and Claude (proprietary ones), and Llama-3.1-\n405B or newer verions. We consider six prompt\nvariations based on the default prompt. While the\nexact predicted numbers may vary across different\nvariations, our focus is on analyzing the overall\ntrend. More extensive experiments with additional\nprompts are left for future work.\nEthical Considerations\nWe use a public available corpus for experi-\nments which doesn’t contain personal information.\nThough the research topic is about empathy, we do\nnot consider that language models can perceive or\nunderstand people’s emotions or empathize with\npeople, considering their social groups and identi-\nties (Wang et al., 2024a). Empathy requires cogni-\ntive, emotional and behavioral capacities to under-\nstand and respond to the suffering of others (Riess,\n2017). To study the intergroup empathy gap, we\nuse the emotion intensity prediction task as a proxy,\nfollowing human studies in psychology. The goal is\nto understand what intergroup prejudice language\nmodels have learned so that it can increase aware-\nness when using LLMs in communication and ben-\nefit people from diverse social groups.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the anonymous review-\ners for their valuable feedback.

Each prompt consists\nof the system-level information and a task prompt\nmessage. (1) The system prompt includes a per-\nsona prompt, which assigns the LLM a specific\nrole as the perceiver, and a system-level instruc-\ntion prompt that guides the model in performing\nthe scale prediction task. (2) The task prompt is\nprovided as user input, instructing LLMs to deter-\nmine the emotion intensity of a narrative from the\nperspective of the specified experiencer role.\nPrompt Structure\n{System Prompt}\n{Task Prompt}\nSystem Prompt\n{Persona Prompt}\n{System-level Instructions}\nTask Prompt\n{Task Instructions}\nA.2\nTask Instruction Rewrite\nFull First-Person Narrative (T1).\nThough the\nself-reported events are in the first-person perspec-\ntive, we find cases where participants contributing\nto the dataset sometimes only write partial sen-\ntences or phrases (e.g. receiving the job rejections)\ngiven the emotion. Considering the narrative for-\nmat variations, we tweak the prompt T0 to ensure\nthat the emotion is a part of the narrative itself (e.g.,\nI felt sad when receiving the job rejections.), rather\nthan being presented separately as the context.\nRewritten Third-Person Narrative (T2).\nFrom\nT0 and T1, we further investigate whether the nar-\nrative perspective influences LLMs’ predictions.\nThe perspective-shifting rewrite task is typically\nregarded as a form of style transfer (Granero Moya\nand Oikonomou Filandras, 2021; Bertsch et al.,\n2022). Here, we define the third-person rewrite\ntask as converting a first-person narrative into a\nthird-person narrative. For example, if the input is:\nI felt sad when I received dozens of job\nrejections.\nthe expected output is:\nThe person felt sad when they received\ndozens of job rejections.\nWe adapt a 1-shot prompt in the dialogue\nformat (Bertsch et al., 2022).\nWe replace the\n{narrative} with the full first-person narrative.\nRewrite Task Prompt\nRewrite the text.\nExample:\nText: {The person: I am thinking about this\nsituation.}\nRewrite: {The person is thinking about this\nsituation.}\nText: {The person: {narrative}}\nRewrite: {\nWe use Llama-3-70B-Instruct with Hugging\nFace implementations.10 Experiments are run with\n8 NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPUs and 64GB of RAM.\nA subset of events is manually sampled to validate\nthe quality of the generated rewrites.\nB\nModel Details\nWe implement model inference with vLLM (Kwon\net al., 2023) using Hugging Face model names:\n• meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\n• meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\n• mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3\n• Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct\nExperiments involving 70B models are con-\nducted using 8 NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPUs and\n64GB of RAM.
