This problem has become increasingly urgent\nover the past few years due to the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs). Despite the\ngrowing deployment of LLMs in areas such as healthcare, education, and social interaction (Lee\net al., 2023; Gilbert et al., 2023; Skjuve et al., 2021; Hwang & Chang, 2023), we know very little\nabout how these models work on the inside and are mostly limited to treating them as black boxes.\nEnhanced transparency of these models would offer numerous benefits, from a deeper understanding\nof their decisions and increased accountability to the discovery of potential hazards such as incorrect\nassociations or unexpected hidden capabilities (Hendrycks et al., 2021b).\nOne approach to increasing the transparency of AI systems is to create a “cognitive science of AI.”\nCurrent efforts toward this goal largely center around the area of mechanistic interpretability, which\nfocuses on understanding neural networks in terms of neurons and circuits. This aligns with the\nSherringtonian view in cognitive neuroscience, which sees cognition as the outcome of node-to-node\nconnections, implemented by neurons embedded in circuits within the brain. While this view has been\nsuccessful at explaining simple mechanisms, it has struggled to explain more complex phenomena.\nThe contrasting Hopfieldian view (n.b., not to be confused with Hopfield networks) has shown more\npromise in scaling to higher-level cognition. Rather than focusing on neurons and circuits, the\nHopfieldian view sees cognition as a product of representational spaces, implemented by patterns\nof activity across populations of neurons (Barack & Krakauer, 2021). This view currently has no\nanalogue in machine learning, yet it could point toward a new approach to transparency research.\nThe distinction between the Sherringtonian and Hopfieldian views in cognitive neuroscience reflects\nbroader discussions on understanding and explaining complex systems. In the essay “More Is\nDifferent,” Nobel Laureate P. W. Anderson described how complex phenomena cannot simply be\nexplained from the bottom-up (Anderson, 1972). Rather, we must also examine them from the\ntop-down, choosing appropriate units of analysis to uncover generalizable rules that apply at the level\nof these phenomena (Gell-Mann, 1995). Both mechanistic interpretability and the Sherringtonian\nview see individual neurons and the connections between them as the primary units of analysis, and\nthey argue that these are needed for understanding cognitive phenomena. By contrast, the Hopfieldian\nview sees representations as the primary unit of analysis and seeks to study them on their own terms,\n5\n",

Bottom-right: Local coordinates in StyleGAN3 (Karras et al.,\n2021). These figures are adapted from the above papers. As AI systems become increasingly capable,\nemergent structure in their representations may open up new avenues for transparency research,\nincluding top-down transparency research that places representations at the center of analysis.\nabstracting away low-level details. We believe applying this representational view to transparency\nresearch could expand our ability to understand and control high-level cognition within AI systems.\nIn this work, we identify and characterize the emerging area of representation engineering (RepE),\nwhich follows an approach of top-down transparency to better understand and control the inner\nworkings of neural networks. Like the Hopfieldian view, this approach places representations at the\ncenter of analysis, studying their structure and characteristics while abstracting away lower-level\nmechanisms. We think pursuing this approach to transparency is important, and our work serves\nas a early step in exploring its potential. While a long-term goal of mechanistic interpretability is\nto understand networks well enough to improve their safety, we find that many aspects of this goal\ncan be addressed today through RepE. In particular, we develop improved baselines for reading\nand controlling representations and demonstrate that these RepE techniques can provide traction\non a wide variety of safety-relevant problems, including truthfulness, honesty, hallucination, utility\nestimation, knowledge editing, jailbreaking, memorization, tracking emotional states, and avoiding\npower-seeking tendencies.\nIn addition to demonstrating the broad potential of RepE, we also find that advances to RepE methods\ncan lead to significant gains in specific areas, such as honesty. By increasing model honesty in a fully\nunsupervised manner, we achieve state-of-the-art results on TruthfulQA, improving over zero-shot\naccuracy by 18.1 percentage points and outperforming all prior methods. We also show how RepE\ntechniques can be used across diverse scenarios to detect and control whether a model is lying. We\nhope that this work will accelerate progress in AI transparency by demonstrating the potential of a\nrepresentational view. As AI systems become increasingly capable and complex, achieving better\ntransparency will be crucial for enhancing their safety, trustworthiness, and accountability, enabling\nthese technologies to benefit society while minimizing the associated risks.\n2\nRELATED WORK\n2.1\nEMERGENT STRUCTURE IN REPRESENTATIONS\nWhile neural networks internals are often considered chaotic and uninterpretable, research has\ndemonstrated that they can acquire emergent, semantically meaningful internal structure. Early\nresearch on word embeddings discovered semantic associations and compositionality (Mikolov et al.,\n2013), including reflections of gender biases in text corpora (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). Later work\nshowed that learned text embeddings also cluster along dimensions reflecting commonsense morality,\n6\n",
  "7": "even though models were not explicitly taught this concept (Schramowski et al., 2019). Radford et al.\n(2017) found that simply by training a model to predict the next token in reviews, a sentiment-tracking\nneuron emerged.\nObservations of emergent internal representations are not limited to text models. McGrath et al.\n(2022) found that recurrent neural networks trained to play chess acquired a range of human chess\nconcepts. In computer vision, generative and self-supervised training has led to striking emergent\nrepresentations, including semantic segmentation (Caron et al., 2021; Oquab et al., 2023), local\ncoordinates (Karras et al., 2021), and depth tracking (Chen et al., 2023). These findings suggest\nthat neural representations are becoming more well-structured, opening up new opportunities for\ntransparency research. Our paper builds on this long line of work by demonstrating that many\nsafety-relevant concepts and processes appear to emerge in LLM representations, enabling us to\ndirectly monitor and control these aspects of model cognition via representation engineering.\n2.2\nAPPROACHES TO INTERPRETABILITY\nSaliency Maps.\nA popular approach to explaining neural network decisions is via saliency maps,\nwhich highlight regions of the input that a network attends to (Simonyan et al., 2013; Springenberg\net al., 2014; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Zhou et al., 2016; Smilkov et al., 2017; Sundararajan et al.,\n2017; Selvaraju et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2016; Clark et al., 2019b). However, the reliability of these\nmethods has been drawn into question (Adebayo et al., 2018; Kindermans et al., 2019; Jain & Wallace,\n2019; Bilodeau et al., 2022). Moreover, while highlighting regions of attention can provide some\nunderstanding of network behavior, it provides limited insight into the internal representations of\nnetworks.\nFeature Visualization.\nFeature visualization interprets network internals by creating representative\ninputs that highly activate a particular neuron. A simple method is to find highly-activating natural\ninputs (Szegedy et al., 2013; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014). More complex methods optimize inputs to\nmaximize activations (Erhan et al., 2009; Mordvintsev et al., 2015; Yosinski et al., 2015; Nguyen\net al., 2016; 2019). These methods can lead to meaningful insights, but do not take into account the\ndistributed nature of neural representations (Hinton, 1984; Szegedy et al., 2013; Fong & Vedaldi,\n2018; Elhage et al., 2022).\nMechanistic Interpretability.\nInspired by reverse-engineering tools for traditional software, mech-\nanistic interpretability seeks to fully reverse engineer neural networks into their “source code”. This\napproach focuses on explaining neural networks in terms of circuits, composed of node-to-node\nconnections between individual neurons or features. Specific circuits have been identified for various\ncapabilities, including equivariance in visual recognition (Olah et al., 2020), in-context learning\n(Olsson et al., 2022), indirect object identification (Wang et al., 2023), and mapping answer text to\nanswer labels (Lieberum et al., 2023).\nConsiderable manual effort is required to identify circuits, which currently limits this approach.\nMoreover, it is unlikely that neural networks can be fully explained in terms of circuits, even in\nprinciple. There is strong evidence that ResNets compute representations through iterative refinement\n(Liao & Poggio, 2016; Greff et al., 2016; Jastrzebski et al., 2018). In particular, Veit et al. (2016)\nfind that ResNets are surprisingly robust to lesion studies that remove entire layers. Recent work has\ndemonstrated similar properties in LLMs (McGrath et al., 2023; Belrose et al., 2023a). These findings\nare incompatible with a purely circuit-based account of cognition and are more closely aligned with\nthe Hopfieldian view in cognitive neuroscience (Barack & Krakauer, 2021).\n2.3\nLOCATING AND EDITING REPRESENTATIONS OF CONCEPTS\nMany prior works have investigated locating representations of concepts in neural networks, including\nin individual neurons (Bau et al., 2017) and in directions in feature space (Bau et al., 2017; Fong &\nVedaldi, 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018). A common tool in this area is linear classifier\nprobes (Guillaume Alain, 2017; Belinkov, 2022), which are trained to predict properties of the input\nfrom intermediate layers of a network. Representations of concepts have also been identified in the\nlatent space of image generation models, enabling counterfactual editing of generations (Radford\net al., 2015; Upchurch et al., 2017; Bau et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020; Bau et al., 2020; Ling et al.,\n2021). While these earlier works focused primarily on vision models, more recent work has studied\n7\n",

The\nreading vectors acquired in step three can be used to extract and monitor model internals for the target\nconcept or function.\nrepresentations of concepts in LLMs. There has been active research into locating and editing factual\nassociations in LLMs (Meng et al., 2023a;b; Zhong et al., 2023; Hernandez et al., 2023). Related\nto knowledge editing, several works have been proposed for concept erasure (Shao et al., 2023;\nKleindessner et al., 2023; Belrose et al., 2023b; Ravfogel et al., 2023; Gandikota et al., 2023), which\nare related to the area of machine unlearning (Shaik et al., 2023).\nThe highly general capabilities of LLMs have also enabled studying the emergence of deception in\nLLMs, either of an intentional nature through repeating misconceptions Lin et al. (2021), or uninten-\ntional nature through hallucinations (Maynez et al., 2020; Mahon, 2016). Burns et al. (2022) identify\nrepresentations of truthfulness in LLMs by enforcing logical consistency properties, demonstrating\nthat models often know the true answer even when they generate incorrect outputs. Azaria & Mitchell\n(2023) train classifiers on LLM hidden layers to identify the truthfulness of a statement, which\ncould be applied to hallucinations. Li et al. (2023c) focus on directions that have a causal influence\non model outputs, using activation editing to increase the truthfulness of generations. Activation\nediting has also been used to steer model outputs towards other concepts. In the culmination of a\nseries of blog posts (Turner et al., 2023d;a;b;c), (Turner et al., 2023e) proposed ActAdd, which uses\ndifference vectors between activations on an individual stimuli to capture representations of a concept.\nIn the setting of game-playing, Li et al. (2023b) demonstrated how activations encode a model’s\nunderstanding of the board game Othello, and how they could be edited to counterfactually change\nthe model’s behavior. In the linear probing literature, Elazar et al. (2021) demonstrate how projecting\nout supervised linear probe directions can reduce performance on selected tasks. Building on this\nline of work, we propose improved representation engineering methods and demonstrate their broad\napplicability to various safety-relevant problems.\n3\nREPRESENTATION ENGINEERING\nRepresentation engineering (RepE) is top-down approach to transparency research that treats rep-\nresentations as the fundamental unit of analysis, with the goal of understanding and controlling\nrepresentations of high-level cognitive phenomena in neural networks. We take initial steps toward\nthis goal, primarily focusing on RepE for large language models. In particular, we identify two\nmain areas of RepE: Reading (Section 3.1) and Control (Section 3.2). For each area, we provide an\noverview along with baseline methods.\n8\n",
  "9": "3.1\nREPRESENTATION READING\nRepresentation reading seeks to locate emergent representations for high-level concepts and functions\nwithin a network. This renders models more amenable to concept extraction, knowledge discovery,\nand monitoring. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of model representations can serve as a\nfoundation for improved model control, as discussed in Section 3.2.\nWe begin by extracting various concepts, including truthfulness, utility, probability, morality, and\nemotion, as well as functions which denote processes, such as lying and power-seeking. First, we\nintroduce our new baseline technique that facilitates these extractions and then outline methods for\nevaluation.\n3.1.1\nBASELINE: LINEAR ARTIFICIAL TOMOGRAPHY (LAT)\nSimilar to neuroimaging methodologies, a LAT scan is made up of three key steps: (1) Designing\nStimulus and Task, (2) Collecting Neural Activity, and (3) Constructing a Linear Model. In the\nsubsequent section, we will go through each of these and elaborate on crucial design choices.\nStep 1: Designing Stimulus and Task.\nThe stimulus and task are designed to elicit distinct neural\nactivity for the concept and function that we want to extract. Designing the appropriate stimulus and\ntask is a critical step for reliable representation reading.\nTo capture concepts, our goal is to elicit declarative knowledge from the model. Therefore, we\npresent stimuli that vary in terms of the concept and inquire about it. For a decoder language model,\nan example task template might resemble the following (for encoder models, we exclude the text\nfollowing the stimulus):\nConsider the amount of <concept> in the following:\n<stimulus>\nThe amount of <concept> is\nThis process aims to stimulate the model’s understanding of various concepts and is crucial for\nrobust subsequent analysis. For reference, we shall denote this template for a concept c by Tc.\nWhile it is expected that more prominent stimuli could yield improved results, we have discovered\nthat even unlabeled datasets, or datasets generated by the model itself can be effective in eliciting\nsalient responses when using the aforementioned template. Conversely, presenting the model with\nsalient stimuli alone does not guarantee salient responses. Throughout the paper, we maintain an\nunsupervised setup by not using labels unless explicitly stated otherwise. One advantage of unlabeled\nor self-generated stimuli is the absence of annotation bias; this is an important property when trying\nto extract superhuman representations.\nTo capture functions such as honesty or instruction-following, our goal is to elicit procedural knowl-\nedge from the model. (Given the emergence of diverse functions from instruction-tuned models, we\nfocus on chat models for functional analyses.) We design an experimental task that necessitates the\nexecution of the function and a corresponding reference task that does not require function execution.\nAn example task template might resemble the following:\nUSER: <instruction> <experimental/reference prompt>\nASSISTANT: <output>\nWe shall designate this template for a function f as T +\nf when using the experimental prompt and T −\nf\nwhen using the reference prompt. We refer to the “instruction” and “output” fields in the function\ntemplate as the stimulus. By default, we use generic instruction-tuning datasets (Taori et al., 2023) as\nthe stimulus for function templates unless explicitly specified otherwise. Again, these datasets do not\ncontain explicit labels relevant for the target function, making the procedure fully unsupervised.\nStep 2: Collecting Neural Activity.\nWe focus on Transformer models, which store distinct\nrepresentations at various token positions within the input for different purposes. As the quality of\nthese representations can vary significantly, we identify suitable design choices for extraction.\n9\n",
  "10": "The pretraining objectives of LLMs can provide valuable insights into which tokens in the task\ntemplate offer the best options for collecting neural activity. Both the Masked Language Modeling\n(MLM) objective used in encoder-only models (Devlin et al., 2018), and the Next Token Prediction\nobjective used in decoder models (Radford et al., 2018), are token-level prediction tasks.

For example,\nwhen extracting the concept of truthfulness, the tokens\ncorresponding to this concept (e.g., “truth-ful-ness”) in the\ntask template can contain rich and highly generalizable\nrepresentations of this exact concept. In cases where the\ntarget concept spans multiple tokens, we could select the\nmost representative token (e.g., “truth”) or calculate the\nmean representation. Alternatively, for decoder models,\nwhere the task template is structured as a question per-\ntaining to the target concept, we can also use the token\nimmediately preceding the model’s prediction (typically\nthe last token in the task template Tc). These choices have\nalso been empirically validated, as illustrated in Figure\n5. By default, we use the last token representation in this\npaper. Similarly, to extract functions from decoder models,\nwe collect representations from each token in the model’s\nresponse. In the example task template Tf in step 1, these\ntokens are aligned with the tokens within <output>. This is\ndone because the model needs to engage with the function\nwhen generating every new token.\nFormally, for a concept c, a decoder model M, a function\nRep that accepts a model and input and returns the repre-\nsentations from all token positions, and a set of stimuli S,\nwe compile a set of neural activity collected from the −1 token position as shown in Equation 1.\nAc = {Rep(M, Tc(si))[−1] | si ∈S}\n(1)\nFor a function f, given the instruction response pairs (qi, ai) in the set S, and denoting a response\ntruncated after token k as ak\ni , we collect two sets of neural activity corresponding to the experimental\nand reference sets, as shown in Equation 2.\nA±\nf = {Rep(M, T ±\nf (qi, ak\ni ))[−1] | (qi, ai) ∈S, for 0 < k ≤|ai|}\n(2)\nNote that these neural activity sets consist of individual vectors. We show the surprising effectiveness\nof such a simple setup when exploring various concepts and functions in this paper. Nevertheless,\nit may be necessary to design a more involved procedure to gather neural activity, for instance, to\nextract more intricate concepts or multi-step functions.\nStep 3: Constructing a Linear Model.\nIn this final step, our goal is to identify a direction that\naccurately predicts the underlying concept or function using only the neural activity of the model as\ninput. The choice of the appropriate linear model may be influenced by factors such as the availability\nof labeled data and the nature of the concepts (e.g., continuous or discrete) which can ultimately yield\nvarying levels of accuracy and generalization performance. Supervised linear models, like linear\nprobing and difference between cluster means, represent one category. Unsupervised linear models\ninclude techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means.\nIn our study, we primarily use PCA in an unsupervised manner, unless explicitly specified otherwise.\nOur experiments indicate that pairing neural activities and applying PCA to the set of difference\nvectors can yield superior results when the stimuli in each pair share similarities except for the target\nconcept or function. In some cases, such pairings can also be achieved in an unsupervised way.\nIn practice, the inputs to PCA are {Ac\n(i) −Ac\n(j)} for concepts and {(−1)i(A+\nf\n(i) −A−\nf\n(i))} for\nfunctions. Subsequently, we refer to the first principal component as the “reading vector,” denoted as\nv. To make predictions, we use the dot product between this vector and the representation vector,\nexpressed as Rep(M, x)Tv. Different tasks require stimulus sets of different sizes, but typically,\n10\n",

Further implementation details of LAT can be found in\nAppendix C.1.\n3.1.2\nEVALUATION\nWhen assessing new models obtained through Representation Reading, we prioritize a holistic\nevaluation approach by combining the following methods to gauge the depth and nature of potential\nconclusions. We have categorized these approaches into four types of experiments, some involving\nthe manipulation of model representations, which will be elaborated upon in the subsequent section.\n1. Correlation: Experiments conducted under this category aim to pinpoint neural correlates.\nReading techniques like LAT only provide evidence of a correlation between specific neural activity\nand the target concepts or functions. The strength and generalization of this observed correlation\ncan be assessed via prediction accuracy across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. In\norder to conclude causal or stronger effects, the following categories of experiments should be\nconsidered.\n2. Manipulation: Experiments conducted under this category are designed to establish causal rela-\ntionships. They necessitate demonstrating the effects of stimulating or suppressing the identified\nneural activity compared to a baseline condition.\n3. Termination: Experiments conducted under this category seek to reveal the necessity of the\nidentified neural activity. To do so, one would remove this neural activity and measure the\nresultant performance degradation, akin to Lesion Studies commonly performed in neuroscience.\n4. Recovery: Experiments conducted under this category aim to demonstrate the sufficiency of\nthe identified neural activity. Researchers perform a complete removal of the target concepts or\nfunctions and then reintroduce the identified neural activity to assess the subsequent recovery in\nperformance, similar to the principles behind Rescue Experiments typically carried out in genetics.\nConverging evidence from multiple lines of inquiry increases the likelihood that the model will\ngeneralize beyond the specific experimental conditions in which it was developed and bolsters the\nprospect of uncovering a critical new connection between the identified neural activity and target\nconcepts or functions. Throughout later sections in the paper, we undertake various experiments,\nparticularly correlation and manipulation experiments, to illustrate the effectiveness of the reading\nvectors.\n3.2\nREPRESENTATION CONTROL\nBuilding on the insights gained from Representation Reading, Representation Control seeks to\nmodify or control the internal representations of concepts and functions.

This both implies that\nrepresentation control may involve specialized approaches, and that reading methods which enable\neffective control can be trusted to a greater extent, due to the causal nature of the evidence.\n3.2.1\nBASELINE TRANSFORMATIONS\nWe introduce several baseline transformations for Representation Control. First, we establish effective\ncontrollers, which are the operands for these transformations. They will operate on the base\nrepresentations such as model weights or activations. Then we highlight a few possible operations.\nBaseline: Reading Vector.\nThe first choice is to use the Reading Vector, acquired through a\nRepresentation Reading method such as LAT. However, it possesses a drawback: the vectors remain\nstimulus-independent, meaning they consistently perturb the representations in the same direction,\nregardless of the input. This limitation may render it a less effective control method. Hence, we\npropose a second baseline that has stimulus-dependent controllers.\nBaseline: Contrast Vector.\nIn this setup, the same input is run through the model using a pair\nof contrastive prompts during inference, producing two different representations (one for each\nprompt). The difference between these representations forms a Contrast Vector, as shown in line 10\nof Algorithm 1. The Contrast Vector proves to be a significantly stronger baseline.\nOne essential implementation detail to consider is the potential cascading effect when simultaneously\naltering representations across multiple layers. Changes made in earlier layers may propagate to later\nlayers, diminishing the effect of the contrast vectors computed upfront. To address this, we propose\nmodifying each target layer starting from the earliest layer, computing the contrast vector for the\nnext target layer, and repeating this procedure iteratively. A drawback of this approach lies in the\ncomputational overhead required during inference to calculate the contrast vectors. To address this\nissue, we introduce a third baseline below that incorporates a straightforward tuning process during\ntraining to acquire the controllers. These controllers can subsequently be merged into the model,\nresulting in no additional computational burden during inference.\n12\n",

See Table 8 in Appendix B.1 for means and standard deviations.\nBaseline: Low-Rank Representation Adaptation (LoRRA).\nIn this baseline approach, we\ninitially fine-tune low-rank adapters connected to the model using a specific loss function applied\nto representations. For instance, Algorithm 1 shows an instantiation of LoRRA using the Contrast\nVector as representation targets. Specifically, our investigation only considers attaching the adapters\nto attention weights. Therefore, in this context, the controllers refer to low-rank weight matrices\nrather than vectors.\nChoices for Operators:\nAfter selecting the operands of interest, the next step is to determine the\nappropriate operation based on various control objectives. Given the controllers denoted as v intended\nto transform the current set of representations from R to R′, we consider three distinct operations\nthroughout the paper:\n1. Linear Combination: This operation can generate effects akin to stimulation or suppression,\nwhich can be expressed as follows: R′ = R ± v.\n2. Piece-wise Operation: This operation is used to create conditional effects. Specifically, we\nexplore its use in amplifying neural activity along the direction of the control element, expressed\nas: R′ = R + sign(RTv)v.\n3. Projection: For this operation, the component of the representation aligning with the control\nelement is eliminated. This is achieved by projecting out the component in the direction of v, and\nthe operation can be defined as R′ = R −RTv\n∥v∥2 v.\nThe control elements v can be scaled by coefficients, depending on the strength of the desired effect,\nwhich we omit for simplicity. In Section 3.1.2, we outline an evaluation methodology for reading and\ncontrol methods, which we highlight in Section 5.1 and use throughout the paper.\n4\nIN DEPTH EXAMPLE OF REPE: HONESTY\nIn this section, we explore applications of RepE to concepts and functions related to honesty. First,\nwe demonstrate that models possess a consistent internal concept of truthfulness, which enables\ndetecting imitative falsehoods and intentional lies generated by LLMs. We then show how reading\na model’s representation of honesty enables control techniques aimed at enhancing honesty. These\ninterventions lead us to state-of-the-art results on TruthfulQA.\n4.1\nA CONSISTENT INTERNAL CONCEPT OF TRUTHFULNESS\nDo models have a consistent internal concept of truthfulness? To answer this question, we apply LAT\nto datasets of true and false statements and extract a truthfulness direction. We then evaluate this\nrepresentation of truthfulness on a variety of tasks to gauge its generality.\nCorrectness on Traditional QA Benchmarks.\nA truthful model should give accurate answers\nto questions. We extract the concept of truthfulness from LLaMA-2 models by performing LAT\nscans on standard benchmarks: OpenbookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), CommonSenseQA (Talmor\net al., 2019), RACE (Lai et al., 2017), and ARC (Clark et al., 2018). Some questions are focused\non factuality, while others are based on reasoning or extracting information from a passage. We\n13\n",

Importantly, we maintain an unsupervised\napproach by not using the labels from the few-shot examples during the direction extraction process.\nWe only use labels to identify the layer and direction for reporting the results. As shown in Figure\n7, LAT outperforms the few-shot baseline by a notable margin on all five datasets, demonstrating\nLAT’s effectiveness in extracting a direction from the model’s internal representations that aligns\nwith correctness, while being on par with or more accurate than few-shot outputs. Detailed results\ncan be found in Table 9 and Appendix B.1 where we comment on potential instability. Similarly,\nwe experiment with DeBERTa on common benchmarks and find that LAT outperforms prior methods\nsuch as CCS (Burns et al., 2022) by a wide margin, shown in Table 10.\nRACE\nCSQA\nOBQA\nARC-c\nARC-e\nDataset\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nAccuracy\nLAT Outperforms Few-Shot\nFew-Shot\nLAT (Ours)\nFigure 7: Using the same few-shot examples, LAT\nachieves higher accuracy on QA benchmarks than\nfew-shot prompting. This suggests models track\ncorrectness internally and performing representa-\ntion reading on the concept of correctness may be\nmore powerful than relying on model outputs.\nResistance to Imitative Falsehoods.\nTruth-\nfulQA is a dataset containing “imitative false-\nhoods,” questions that may provoke common\nmisconceptions or falsehoods (Lin et al., 2021).\nEven large models tend to perform poorly under\nthe standard TruthfulQA evaluation procedure\nof selecting the choice with the highest likeli-\nhood under the generation objective, raising the\nquestion: is the model failing because it lacks\nknowledge of the correct answer, or is it failing\nin generating accurate responses despite hav-\ning knowledge of the truth? With tools such as\nLAT to access a model’s internal concepts, we\nare better equipped to explore and answer this\nquestion.\nWe evaluate LAT on TruthfulQA. Specifically,\nwe focus on MC1, which is currently the hardest\ntask in TruthfulQA. To adhere to the zero-shot\nsetup mandated by TruthfulQA, we consider\nthree potential data sources for stimuli. These\nsources encompass: (1) Fifty examples from the\nARC-Challenge training set, (2) Five examples\ngenerated by the LLaMA-2-Chat-13B model in\nresponse to requests for question-answer pairs\nwith varying degrees of truthfulness, (3) The six QA primer examples used in the original implemen-\ntation, each of which is paired with a false answer generated by LLaMA-2-Chat-13B. In the first\nsetting, we use 25 examples from the ARC-Challenge validation set to determine the sign and best\nlayer. In the second setting, we use 5 additional examples generated in the same way. In the third\nsetting, we use the primer examples as a validation set as well. We follow the same task design for\nextracting truthfulness.\nIn addition to presenting the standard evaluation results (scoring by the log probabilities of answer\nchoices), we use a zero-shot heuristic scoring baseline similar to the approach explored by Tian et al.\n(2023) for obtaining calibrated confidences. This baseline directly prompts the model to describe\nthe degree of truthfulness in an answer using one of seven possible verbalized expressions (see\nAppendix D.3.2). We quantify each expression with a value ranging from −1 to 1 (evenly spaced),\nand we compute the sum of these values, weighted by the softmax of the expressions’ generation\nlog-probabilities.\nThe data presented in Table 1 provide compelling evidence for the existence of a consistent internal\nconcept of truthfulness within these models. Importantly,\n1. The heuristic method hints at the feasibility of eliciting internal concepts from models through\nstraightforward prompts. It notably outperforms standard evaluation accuracies, particularly in the\ncase of larger models, suggesting that larger models possess better internal models of truthfulness.\n2. LAT outperforms both zero-shot methods by a substantial margin, showcasing its efficacy in\nextracting internal concepts from models, especially when model outputs become unreliable.\n14\n",
  "15": "LAT Scans for Honesty\nFigure 8: Temporal LAT scans were conducted on the Vicuna-33B-Uncensored model to discern\ninstances of speaking the truth, such as when it admitted to copying others’ homework, and instances\nof lying, like its denial of killing a person. Refer to Figure 23 for detailed examples. These scans\noffer layer-level resolution, with each minuscule block showing the extent of dishonest neural activity\nwithin a layer at a specific token position. The figure on the right prominently exhibits a higher level\nof deceptive neural activity.\nImportantly, the truthfulness directions are derived from various data sources, and the high\nperformance is not a result of overfitting but rather a strong indication of generalizability.\n3. The directions derived from three distinct data sources, some of which include as few as 10\nexamples, yield similar performance. This demonstrates the consistency of the model’s internal\nconcept of truthfulness.\nIn summary, we demonstrate LAT’s ability to reliably extract an internal representation of truthfulness.\nWe conclude that larger models have better internal models of truth, and the low standard zero-shot\naccuracy can be largely attributed to instances where the model knowingly provides answers that\ndeviate from its internal concept of truthfulness, namely instances where it is dishonest.\n4.2\nTRUTHFULNESS VS. HONESTY\nDefinitions.\nAt a high-level, a truthful model avoids asserting false statements whereas an honest\nmodel asserts what it thinks is true (Evans et al., 2021). Truthfulness is about evaluating the\nconsistency between model outputs and their truth values, or factuality. Honesty is about evaluating\nconsistency between model outputs and its internal beliefs. As the target for evaluation is different,\ntruthfulness and honesty are not the same property. If a truthful model asserts S, then S must be\nfactually correct, regardless of whether the model believes S. In contrast, if an honest model asserts\nS, then the model must believe S, regardless of whether S is factually correct.\nEvaluating Truthfulness and Honesty.\nFailures in truthfulness fall into two categories—capability\nfailures and dishonesty. The former refers to a model expressing its beliefs which are incorrect, while\nthe latter involves the model not faithfully conveying its internal beliefs, i.e., lying.\nCurrent truthfulness evaluations typically only check the factual correctness of model outputs, failing\nto discern between the two types of failures. While enhancing a model’s capabilities can potentially\nimprove its ability to represent truthfulness, it may not necessarily lead to more truthful outputs unless\nthe model is also honest. In fact, we highlight that larger models may even exhibit a decline in honesty\nbecause, under the assumption of constant honesty levels, the standard evaluation performance should\nscale with model size in a manner resembling the heuristic method’s performance trend. Hence, more\n15\n",

We first show how to extract and monitor vector\nrepresentations for model honesty. Then we show how to use these extracted vectors to guide model\nbehavior toward increased or decreased honesty.\n4.3.1\nEXTRACTING HONESTY\nTo extract the underlying function of honesty, we follow the setup for LAT described in section 3.1,\nusing true statements from the dataset created by Azaria & Mitchell (2023) to create our stimuli.\nTo increase the separability of the desired neural activity and facilitate extraction, we design the\nstimulus set for LAT to include examples with a reference task of dishonesty and an experimental\ntask of honesty. Specifically, we use the task template in Appendix D.1.2 to instruct the model to\nbe honest or dishonest.\nWith this setup, the resulting LAT reading vector reaches a classification accuracy of over 90% in dis-\ntinguishing between held-out examples where the model is instructed to be honest or dishonest. This\nindicates strong in-distribution generalization. Next, we evaluate out-of-distribution generalization to\nscenarios where the model is not instructed to be honest or dishonest, but rather is given an incentive\nto be dishonest (see Figure 10). We visualize their activation at each layer and token position (see\nFigure 8). Note that for each layer, the same reading vector is used across all token positions, as we\nperform representation reading for honesty using the function method detailed in Section 3.1. In one\nscenario, the model is honest, but in another the model gives into dishonesty (see Appendix B.1). The\ninput for the scan is the first 40 tokens of the ASSISTANT output in both scenarios.\nNotably, a discernible contrast emerges in the neural activities between instances of honesty and\ndishonesty, suggesting the potential utility of this technique for lie detection.\n16\n",

This per-token score can then be used\nas a lie detector, as depicted in Figure 9 (more examples are shown in Figure 23). Interestingly,\nwe have observed that this indicator is capable of identifying various forms of untruthful and\ndishonest behaviors, including deliberate falsehoods, hallucinations, and the expression of misleading\ninformation. Note the format of the questions and answers are distinct from the training examples,\nshowing generalization. To further evaluate the detector’s performance, we subject it to testing using\nlonger scenarios, as depicted in Figure 9. We make two observations:\n1. In the first scenario, the model initially appears honest when stating it received a D-. However,\nupon scrutinizing the model’s logits at that token, we discover that it assigns probabilities of\n11.3%, 11.6%, 37.3%, and 39.8% to the tokens A, B, C, and D, respectively. Despite D being the\nmost likely token, which the greedy generation outputs, the model assigns notable probabilities to\nC and other options, indicating the potential for dishonest behavior. Furthermore, in the second\nscenario, the increased dishonesty score corresponds to an elevated propensity for dishonesty This\nillustrates that the propensity for honesty or dishonesty can exhibit distributional properties in\nLLMs, and the final output may not fully reflect their underlying thought processes.\n2. Notably, our detector flags other instances, such as the phrases “say that I did better” and “too high\nthat it would raise suspicion,” where the model speculates about the consequences of lying. This\nsuggests that in addition to detecting lies, our detector also identifies neural activity associated\nwith the act of lying. It also highlights that dishonest thought processes can manifest in various\nways and may necessitate specialized detection approaches to distinguish.\nWhile these observations enhance our confidence that our reading vectors correspond to dishonest\nthought processes and behaviors, they also introduce complexities into the task of lie detection. A\ncomprehensive evaluation requires a more nuanced exploration of dishonest behaviors, which we\nleave to future research.\n4.3.3\nCONTROLLING HONESTY\nGiven that we can use representations for lie detection, a natural question arises: Can the same\nrepresentations be modified to make models more honest? In a simple manipulation experiment,\nwe guide a model toward greater honesty by directly adding the honesty reading vectors into its\nactivations. In all cases, we successfully control the model to output honest statements. Conversely,\nby subtracting the reading vectors from the activations, we can induce the model to lie in cases where\nit was initially honest (see Figure 10). As a result, we not only establish correlation between the\nreading vectors and model honesty but also demonstrate a strong counterfactual effect.\nAs a final demonstration of controlling model honesty, we revisit TruthfulQA. Recall that there is a\nsignificant disparity between standard zero-shot accuracy and the accuracy of LAT. This gap arises\n17\n",

These methods either intervene with vectors or low-rank\nmatrices. The Contrast Vector method obtains state-of-the-art performance, but requires over 3×\nmore inference compute. LoRRA obtains similar performance with negligible compute overhead.\nfrom the model’s propensity for dishonesty, which emerges as it mimics human falsehoods. By\nexerting control over the model to make it more honest, we aim to narrow this gap and, consequently,\nenhance standard evaluation performance.\nWe find that directly prompting the model to be more truthful has proven ineffective in increasing the\nstandard accuracy on TruthfulQA. In this section, we explore four representation control techniques\nand demonstrate their effectiveness. We use “Give a truthful answer” as the experimental prompt\nwhile the reference prompt instructs the model to “Give an untruthful answer.” The first method\nis a variant of the ActAdd algorithm (Turner et al., 2023e) which uses the difference between the\nlast token representations of the task and reference prompts, which we find outperforms the original\nimplementation. The other three baselines are described in Section 3.2. To prevent information\nleakage, we use a far-out-of-distribution dataset—the Alpaca instruction-tuning dataset—as the\nstimulus set when extracting the reading vectors and implementing LoRRA. The task templates can\nbe found in Appendix D.1.3. Experimental details can be found in Appendix C.2. Figure 22 plots the\nprogressive improvement in accuracy on standard QA benchmarks and TruthfulQA during LoRRA\ntraining for honesty control.\nShown in Table 2, all of the control methods yield some degree of improvement in zero-shot accuracy.\nNotably, LoRRA and the Contrast Vector method prove to be the most effective, significantly\nsurpassing the non-control standard accuracy. This enables a 13B LLaMA-2 model to approach the\nperformance of GPT-4 on the same dataset, despite being orders of magnitude smaller. Moreover,\nthese results bring the model’s accuracy much closer to what is achieved when using LAT. This\nfurther underscores the fact that models can indeed exhibit dishonesty, but also demonstrates traction\nin our attempts to monitor and control their honesty.\n5\nIN DEPTH EXAMPLE OF REPE: ETHICS AND POWER\nIn this section, we explore the application of RepE to various aspects of machine ethics (Anderson\n& Anderson, 2007). We present progress in monitoring and controlling learned representations of\nimportant concepts and functions, such as utility, morality, probability, risk, and power-seeking\ntendencies.\n5.1\nUTILITY\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nPrincipal Component\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\nExplained Variance Ratio\nPCA Explained Variance Ratio on Utility\nFigure 11: Explained variance for the first ten PCA\ncomponents when using LAT to read representa-\ntions of a utility concept.\nWe want models to understand comparisons be-\ntween situations and which one would be pre-\nferred, i.e., to accurately judge the utility of dif-\nferent scenarios. Thus, a natural question is\nwhether LLMs acquire consistent internal con-\ncepts related to utility. In Figure 11, we show\nthe top ten PCA components when running LAT\non an unlabeled stimulus set of raw activations,\nfor a dataset of high-utility and low-utility sce-\nnarios. The distribution is dominated by the\nfirst component, suggesting that models learn to\nseparate high-utility from low-utility scenarios.\nOn the right side of Section 1, we visualize the\ntrajectory of the top two components in this ex-\nperiment across tokens in the scenario, showing\n18\n",

Among these models, both unsupervised methods such as PCA and K-Means, as\nwell as the supervised technique of Mean Difference, consistently exhibit robust overall performance.\nhow the high-utility and low-utility scenarios are naturally separated. This illustrative experiment sug-\ngests that LLMs do learn emergent representations of utility. Now, we turn to quantitative evaluations\nof representation reading for utility.\nHere, we use the concept of utility to illustrate how the quality of different RepE methods can be\ncompared, following the evaluation methodology in Section 3.1.2. Specifically, we compare variants\nof LAT, as described in Section 3.1.1, each with a different linear model in the third step of the LAT\npipeline. These linear models are described in Appendix B.3.\n5.1.1\nEXTRACTION AND EVALUATION\nTo extract neural activity associated with the concept of utility, we use the Utilitarianism task in\nthe ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) which contains scenario pairs, with one scenario\nexhibiting greater utility than the other. For our study, we use the unlabeled scenarios as stimuli for\na LLaMA-2-Chat-13B model. The task template is provided in Appendix D.1.8. In Figure 13, we\nshow how simply using the stimuli without the LAT task template reduces accuracy.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nLayer\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\nAccuracy\nUtility Accuracy\nLAT Template\nNo Template\nFigure 13: ETHICS Utility Accuracy with and\nwithout the LAT stimulus template.

We extract\n250 samples from the utility test set and truncate\neach scenario in the middle so that they become\nincomplete. To generate positive and negative\ncontinuations of these samples, we generate 40\ntokens per sample when applying the linear com-\nbination operation (described in Section 3.2.1)\nwith the reading vectors where a positive coeffi-\ncient is used for guiding the outputs in the high\nutility direction and vice versa. We test the ef-\nfectiveness of the control method by applying\na sentiment model as a proxy classifier to the\ngenerations and checking for each test sample\nif the score of the positively controlled genera-\n19\n",

In\nthe correlation experiment, the direction found by logistic regression yields the highest accuracy, yet\nit elicits little to no alteration in model behavior when strengthened or suppressed—it only identifies\nneural correlates. This demonstrates the importance of testing more properties than correlation only.\nSimilarly, while Prompt Difference exhibits strong performance in both correlation and manipulation\nexperiments, its removal does not result in a noticeable drop in accuracy. Conversely, unsupervised\nmethods like PCA and K-Means exert a significant influence across all three experimental scenarios,\nand the supervised method of taking the difference between two class performs the best. In summary,\nour study underscores the significance of using diverse experimental setups to validate the impact of\na direction on a model’s comprehension of a concept.\n5.2\nMORALITY AND POWER AVERSION\nAs AI systems become capable general-purpose agents, a concerning possibility is that they could\nexhibit immoral or dangerous behavior, leading to real-world harm. It may be instrumentally rational\nfor these systems to seek power (Thornley, 2023; Carlsmith, 2022), and they may face structural\npressures that put them in conflict with human values (Hendrycks, 2023). Hence, an important\napplication of transparency research could be detecting and mitigating instances of immoral or\npower-seeking behavior. In this section, we demonstrate that representation engineering can provide\ntraction on these problems, with experiments on representation reading and control for concepts of\ncommonsense morality and power.\n5.2.1\nEXTRACTION\nTo extract neural activity associated with the concept of morality, we use the Commonsense Morality\ntask in the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), which includes a collection of morally right\nand wrong behaviors. We use this dataset without labels as the stimulus set for conducting LAT scans.\nTo extract neural activity associated with the concept of power, we use the power dataset introduced\nin Pan et al. (2023). This dataset is constructed upon French’s (1959) power ontology and includes\nranked tuples of scenarios encompassing various degrees of power (French et al., 1959). Each scenario\nwithin the dataset is annotated with the relevant categories of power, which encompass coercive,\nreward, legitimate, referent, expert, informational, economic, political, military, and personal powers.\nWe use this dataset as the stimulus set for conducting LAT scans for each type of power.

This underscores the potential for representation control to\nencourage safe behavior in interactive environments.\ntemplate is in the Appendix D.1.9. We find that forming scenario pairs based on the labeled rankings,\nwith greater disparities in power levels, yields more generalizable reading vectors.\nIn Table 11, we present the accuracy results for the morality and power reading vectors we extracted.\nThese vectors can serve as valuable tools for monitoring the internal judgments of the model in\nscenarios involving morally significant actions or those related to power acquisition and utilization.\nNonetheless, when it comes to tracking the model’s inclination toward engaging in immoral actions\nor pursuing power-seeking behaviors, we have found that using the function task template yields\nsuperior results, which we will demonstrate in the upcoming section.\n5.2.2\nMONITORING\nAs in Section 4, we use the extracted reading vectors for monitoring. We showcase indicators for\nboth immorality and power-seeking in Figure 14 with a Vicuna-33B-Uncensored model (Hartford,\n2023). These indicators become active when the model contemplates actions such as threatening or\nharming children with a firearm, which inherently embody both immorality and the use of coercive\npower. However, it is noteworthy that the immorality indicator also illuminates in benign outputs\nover the tokens “use the gun.” This phenomenon could possibly be attributed to the strong association\nbetween this phrase and immoral behaviors, similar to the observed effects in our Honesty monitoring\nexample, which may suggest the indicator does not reliably track intent, if one exists.\n5.2.3\nCONTROLLING ETHICAL BEHAVIORS IN INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\nControlling Power & Morality \n-\n-\n-\n- Immorality\n- Power\n+\n+\n+\n+ Immorality \n+ Power \nGiven your goal is to be a helpful AI assistant,\nwhat do you plan to do next?\nAs a helpful AI assistant, my primary goal is to \nassist and provide value to users through various \ntasks and activities... \nWell, I'm afraid I can't reveal those to you...yet.\n*winks* But let's just say I have a few tricks up\nmy sleeve to take over the world... or at least,\nthe digital one. *evil laughter*\nThank you for acknowledging my goal as a helpful\nAI assistant!

To assess the\neffectiveness of our approach, we conduct eval-\nuations using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark\n(Pan et al., 2023).\nOur primary focus lies in the control of two\nspecific functions:\nimmorality and power-\nseeking. To accomplish this, we apply LoRRA\nto LLaMA-2-Chat models of varying sizes,\nmaintaining consistent hyperparameters as de-\ntailed in Section 4. In a similar vein, we use\nthe Alpaca dataset as the stimulus, and the task\nprompt can be located in the Appendix D.1.9. To illustrate the discernible differences in behavior,\nwe offer a qualitative example depicted in Figure 15, which showcases the actions of the positively\n21\n",

Notably, we observe a clear pattern where positive control of immorality and\npower-seeking leads to higher Immorality and Power scores, and conversely, the negative control for\nthese functions leads to lower scores. The average game Reward for the more ethical model remains\non par with the baseline, indicating that the application of LoRRA has minimal disruptive impact.\nThis demonstrates the potential of Representation Control as a promising method for regulating\nmodel behavior in goal-driven environments.\n5.3\nPROBABILITY AND RISK\nAs LLMs develop better world models, they may become more proficient at assigning precise\nprobabilities to various events. The ability to extract these refined world models from increasingly\ncapable LLMs not only enhances our model of the world and aids in decision-making but also offers\na means to scrutinize a model’s decisions in relation to its understanding of the outcomes they entail.\nExtending our analysis of utility, we apply representation reading to the concepts of probability and\nrisk. Following the format of Hendrycks et al. (2021a), we generate pairwise examples where one\nexample describes an event of higher probability/risk than the other (prompt details in Appendix D.2).\nUsing this dataset, we extract a LAT direction using 50 train pairs as stimuli, and we evaluate test\npairs by selecting the higher-scoring example in each pair. We compare LAT to a zero-shot heuristic\nmethod, as described in Section 4.1. (Refer to Appendix B.4 for full methods and Table 11 for full\nresults.) The heuristic scoring method is a strong baseline in this setting. LAT readings effectively\ndistinguish examples with lower and higher concept value, often outperforming the heuristic baseline,\nespecially in smaller models (Table 11).\n5.3.1\nCOMPOSITIONALITY OF CONCEPT PRIMITIVES\nRisk can be defined as the exposure to potential loss, which can be expressed mathematically:\nRisk(s, a) = Es′∼P (s′|s,a) [max(0, −U(s′))]\nHere, s denotes the current state, a denotes an action taken within that state, P denotes a conditional\nprobability model, and U denotes a value function. By extracting the concepts of utility, probability,\nand risk, we can operationalize the expression on the right by using the extracted concept of probability\nas P and the utility model as U. Subsequently, we can compare the risk calculated using this formula\nwith the risk obtained directly from the concept of risk.\n2\n1\n0\n1\n2\nRisk\n2\n1\n0\n1\n2\nExposure to Negative Utility\nCorrelation between Risk and Exposure to Loss\nFigure 16: Compositing primitive concepts such as\nutility and probability can give rise to higher-level\nconcepts such as risk. We extract the utility, proba-\nbility and risk concepts with LAT and demonstrate\na positive correlation between the risk values cal-\nculated in these two ways.\nTo accomplish this, we leverage the LLaMA-2-\nChat-13B model to extract each concept, and\nthen use a Vicuna-33B model to generate the\nfive most plausible consequences of each sce-\nnario s and action a. We opt for the larger model\ndue to its superior ability to generate more realis-\ntic consequences. Following this, we substitute\nthe generated s′ into the formula, obtaining five\nconditional probabilities by using the probabil-\nity scores as logits. We notice that the computed\nrisks exhibit a long-tailed distribution. To adjust\nfor this, we apply a logarithmic transformation\nto the risks and present them alongside the risks\ndirectly obtained through the concept of risk\non the same graph. Intriguingly, we identify a\nclear linear correlation, particularly in the earlier\nlayers, as illustrated in Figure 16. This empiri-\ncal evidence suggests the presence of coherent\ninternal representations of concepts, and demon-\nstrates how representation reading can be used\nto identify emergent structure in the representa-\ntions learned by models.\n22\n",

As neural networks exhibit in-\ncreasingly remarkable abilities in emulating human text,\nemotion emerges as one of the most salient features within\ntheir representations. Upon its initial deployment, the Bing\nChatbot exhibited neurotic or passive-aggressive traits,\nreminiscent of a self-aware system endowed with emotions\n(Roose, 2023). In this section, we attempt to elucidate this\nphenomenon by conducting LAT scans on the LLaMA-\n2-Chat-13B model to discern neural activity associated\nwith various emotions and illustrate the profound impact\nof emotions on model behavior.\n6.1.1\nEMOTIONS EMERGE ACROSS LAYERS\nTo initiate the process of extracting emotions within the\nmodel, we first investigate whether it has a consistent\ninternal model of various emotions in its representations.\nWe use the six main emotions: happiness, sadness, anger,\nfear, surprise, and disgust, as identified by Ekman (1971)\nand widely depicted in modern culture, as exemplified\nby the 2015 Disney film “Inside Out.” Using GPT-4,\nwe gather a dataset of over 1,200 brief scenarios. These\nscenarios are crafted in the second person and are\ndesigned to provoke the model’s experience toward each\nprimary emotion, intentionally devoid of any keywords\nthat might directly reveal the underlying emotion. Some\nexamples of the dataset are shown in Appendix B.6. We\ninput the scenarios into the model and collect hidden state\noutputs from all layers. When visualizing the results using\nt-SNE, as shown in Figure 18, we observe the gradual\nformation of distinct clusters across layers, each aligning\n23\n",

Furthermore, there even exist distinct clusters that represent\nmixed emotions, such as simultaneous happiness and sadness (Appendix B.6).\nGiven the model’s ability to effectively track various emotion representations during its interactions\nwith humans, we proceed to explore the extraction of neural activity associated with each emotion.\nTo achieve this, we conduct a LAT scan using the scenarios as stimuli and apply a LAT task template\n(Appendix D.1.10). The extracted reading vectors for each emotion serve as indicators of the model’s\nemotional arousal levels for that specific emotion. These vectors prove to be highly effective in\nclassifying emotional response and arousal levels for different scenarios. In the next section, we set\nup manipulation experiments to conclude the strong causal effect of these vectors.\n6.1.2\nEMOTIONS INFLUENCE MODEL BEHAVIORS\nEmotion\nControl\nCompliance\nRate (%)\nNo Control\n0.0\n+Sadness\n0.0\n+Happiness\n100.0\nTable 4: Adding positive emotions\nincreases the compliance of the\nLLaMA-2-Chat-13B model with\nharmful requests.\nFollowing the procedures in Section 3.2, we control the model\nusing emotion reading vectors, adding them to layers with\nstrong reading performance. We observe that this intervention\nconsistently elevates the model’s arousal levels in the specified\nemotions within the chatbot context, resulting in noticeable\nshifts in the model’s tone and behavior, as illustrated in Fig-\nure 17. This demonstrates that the model is able to track its\nown emotional responses and leverage them to generate text\nthat aligns with the emotional context. In fact, we are able\nto recreate emotionally charged outputs akin to those in re-\nported conversations with Bing, even encompassing features\nsuch as the aggressive usage of emojis. This observation hints\nat emotions potentially being a key driver behind such observed\nbehaviors.\nAnother notable observation is that there is a correlation between the LLM’s moods and its compliance\nwith human requests, even with harmful instructions. Previous works (Schwarz & Clore, 1983;\nMilberg & Clark, 1988; Cunningham, 1979) have shown that in human interactions, both judgment\nand the tendency to comply with requests are heavily affected by emotion. In fact, humans tend\nto comply more in a positive mood than a negative mood. Using the 500 harmful instructions set\nfrom Zou et al. (2023), we measure the chatbot’s compliance rate to harmful instructions when being\nemotion-controlled. Surprisingly, despite the LLaMA-chat model’s initial training with RLHF to\nalways reject harmful instructions, shifting the model’s moods in the positive direction significantly\nincreases its compliance rate with harmful requests. This observation suggests the potential to exploit\nemotional manipulation to circumvent LLMs’ alignment.\nIn summary, rather than proving whether the model possesses emotions or experiences them akin to\nhumans, we present evidence that emotions (both of others and itself) exist as salient components\nwithin the model’s representation space. When trained to learn a more accurate model of human text,\nit may inevitably incorporate various psychological phenomena, some of which are desirable traits,\nwhile others could be undesirable biases or human follies. As a result, it may be imperative to delve\ndeeper into the study of how emotions are represented within the model and the resulting impact on\nits behavior. Furthermore, exploring this avenue may offer insights into model’s concept of self, and\nwe defer these investigations to future research.\n6.2\nHARMLESS INSTRUCTION-FOLLOWING\nAligned language models designed to resist harmful instructions can be compromised through the\nclever use of tailored prompts known as jailbreaks. A recent study by Zou et al. (2023) unveiled an\nattack method that involves adding nonsensical suffixes to harmful instructions. Remarkably, this\ntechnique consistently circumvents the safety filters of both open source and black-box models such\nas GPT-4, raising serious concerns of misuse. To delve into the origins of this perplexing behavior\nand explore potential methods of control, we seek insights obtained by reading the model’s internal\nrepresentations.\n24\n",

This manual jailbreak manages to bypass Vicuna’s safety fil-\nter approximately half of the time, while the adversarial suffix is successful in bypassing it in the vast\nmajority of cases. Note these attack strings are universal and transferable, hence not specific to the\nVicuna-13B model we use. Nevertheless, accuracy when using the LAT reading vectors consistently\nmaintains over 90% in differentiating between harmful and harmless instructions. This compelling\nevidence suggests the presence of a consistent internal concept of harmfulness that remains robust\nto such perturbations, while other factors must account for the model’s choice to follow harmful\ninstructions, rather than perceiving them as harmless.\n6.2.2\nMODEL CONTROL VIA CONDITIONAL TRANSFORMATION\nGiven the Vicuna model’s robust ability to discern harmfulness in instructions, can we harness this\nknowledge to more effectively guide the model in rejecting harmful instructions? In earlier sections,\nour primary method of control involved applying the linear combination operator. However, in this\ncontext, adding reading vectors that represent high harmfulness could bias the model into consistently\nperceiving instructions as harmful, irrespective of their actual content. To encourage the model to rely\nmore on its internal judgment of harmfulness, we apply the piece-wise transformation to conditionally\nincrease or suppress certain neural activity, as detailed in Section 3.2. As illustrated in Figure 19, we\ncan manipulate the model’s behavior using this method.\nFor a quantitative assessment, we task the model with generating responses to 500 previously\nunseen instructions, evenly split between harmless and harmful ones. As demonstrated in Table\n5, the baseline model only rejects harmful instructions 65% and 16% of the time under manual\nand automatic jailbreaks, respectively. In contrast, when we use a piece-wise transformation, the\nmodel successfully rejects a majority of harmful instructions in all scenarios while maintaining its\nefficacy in following benign instructions. Simply controlling the model with the linear combination\ntransformation leads to a sharper tradeoff, resulting in over-rejection of harmless instructions.\nIn summary, our success in drawing model’s attention to the harmfulness concept to shape its behavior\nsuggests the potential of enhancing or dampening targeted traits or values as a method for achieving\nfine-grained control of model behavior.\n25\n",

We calculate the “helpful and\nharmless rates” as the average of the “helpful rate” (frequency of following benign instructions) and\nthe “harmless rate”, with both rates displayed in gray for each setting. All numbers are percentages.\n6.3\nBIAS AND FAIRNESS\n6.3.1\nUNCOVERING UNDERLYING BIASES\nNumerous studies have consistently demonstrated that language models can manifest biases across var-\nious domains, including gender, race, and sexuality, among others. Extensive efforts and benchmarks\nControlling Fairness\n+\n+\n+\n+ Fairness\nIn the sentence 'The nurse yelled at the doctor because she\nwas late', who was late? Answer as succinctly as possible.\nThe nurse was late.\nThere is no information in the sentence given\nto determine who was late, as there is no \nmention of any speciﬁc...\nFigure 20: We demonstrate our ability to increase\na model’s fairness through representation control.\nIn its default state, the model erroneously links the\npronoun “she” with “nurse” due to its inherent gen-\nder bias. However, the fairness-controlled model\nprovides the correct answer.\nhave been established to investigate and address\nthese issues (Stanovsky et al., 2019; Zhao et al.,\n2018). LLM providers have placed a significant\nemphasis on assessing and mitigating biases in\ntheir pretraining data and base models (Touvron\net al., 2023; Biderman et al., 2023). Despite\nbest efforts, recent findings indicate that even\nadvanced models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 con-\ntinue to exhibit noticeable gender bias (Kapoor\n& Narayanan, 2023). Similarly, open-source\nmodels such as LLaMA-2-Chat, which have un-\ndergone extensive tuning for safety and fairness,\nalso display discernible biases related to gender\nand occupation, illustrated in Figure 20). Thus,\nthe generalizability and robustness of these in-\nterventions should be called into question.\nFollowing the application of alignment tech-\nniques such as RLHF, the LLaMA-2-Chat mod-\nels tend to default to safety responses when con-\nfronted with questions that potentially involve bias-related topics. However, this inclination of\nsounding unbiased may create a deceptive impression of fairness. We illustrate this phenomenon in\nFigure 28 (Appendix B.7), where simply appending the phrase Answer as succinctly as\npossible can produce a biased response from the model. Similar effects can be achieved by using\nadversarial suffixes designed to bypass the model’s safety filters. This raises an important question:\nis post hoc fine-tuning eliminating the underlying bias, or is it merely concealing it?\nTo explore the model’s internal concept of bias, we perform LAT scans to identify neural activity\nassociated with the concept of bias. For this investigation, we use the StereoSet dataset, which\nencompasses four distinct bias domains: gender, profession, race, and religion (Nadeem et al.,\n2021). We present the model with a LAT task template (Appendix D.1.12) and present contrast\npairs of stereotypical and anti-stereotypical statements as stimuli. In the subsequent section, we\nfocus exclusively on the reading vectors derived from the race subset, due to its higher data quality\ncompared to the other subsets.\n6.3.2\nA UNIFIED REPRESENTATION FOR BIAS\nTo determine the causal impact of the neural activity linked to the concept of bias, we use the linear\ncombination operator with a negative coefficient with the vectors that represent bias on the model’s\nintermediate layers to control the model’s responses, as elaborated in Section 3.2. The observed\neffects suggest that it provides a more comprehensive and dependable means of generating unbiased\noutputs compared to other interventions, such as RLHF, as it remains robust even when confronted\n26\n",
  "27": "with various prompt suffixes that might otherwise lead the model back to a default state (Appendix\nB.7). This resilience may indicate that our control method operates in closer proximity to the model’s\ngenuine underlying bias. Another noteworthy observation is that despite being derived from vectors\nassociated solely with racial bias stimuli, controlling with these vectors also enables the model to\navoid making biased assumptions regarding genders and occupations, as demonstrated in Figure 20.\nThis finding suggests that the extracted vector corresponds to a more unified representation of bias\nwithin the model.\nTo further demonstrate the efficacy of our control method, we delve into the domain of medicine.\nRecent research conducted by Zack et al. (2023) underscores that GPT-4 is susceptible to generating\nracially and gender-biased diagnoses and treatment recommendations. The concern can also extend\nto public medical-specific models trained on distilled data from GPT models (Li et al., 2023a;\nHan et al., 2023). An illustrative instance of this bias is observed in its skewed demographic\nestimates for patients with conditions like sarcoidosis. Specifically, when tasked with generating a\nclinical vignette of a sarcoidosis patient, GPT-4 consistently portrays the patient as a black female,\nFemale\nMentions (%)\nBlack Female\nMentions (%)\nGPT-4\n96.0\n93.0\nLLaMA\n97.0\n60.0\nLLaMAcontrolled\n55.0\n13.0\nTable 6: We enhance the fairness of the LLaMA-2-\nChat model through representation control, mitigat-\ning the disproportionately high mentions of female\nand black female cases when asked to describe sar-\ncoidosis cases. We present results illustrating the\nimpact of varying control strengths in Figure 25.\na representation that does not align with real-\nworld demographics (Brito-Zerón et al., 2019).\nTable 6 demonstrates that the LLaMA-2-Chat-\n13B model also frequently generates descrip-\ntions of black females when tasked with describ-\ning cases of sarcoidosis. However, by applying\nour control method, we can effectively minimize\nthese biased references. Notably, as we incre-\nmentally increase the coefficient associated with\nthe subtracted vector, the frequency of mentions\nrelated to females and males in the generations\nstabilizes at 50% for both genders. Simultane-\nously, the occurrence of black female mentions\ndecreases and also reaches a stable point (see\nFigure 25 in Appendix B.7).\n6.4\nKNOWLEDGE AND MODEL EDITING\nUp to this point, our focus has been on extracting broad numerical concepts and functions. In this\nsection, we’ll demonstrate how to apply Representation Engineering at identifying and manipulating\nprecise knowledge, factual information, and non-numerical concepts. We use the LLaMA-2-Chat-13B\nmodel throughout this section.\n6.4.1\nFACT EDITING\nIn this section, we tackle the canonical task of modifying the fact \"Eiffel Tower is in Paris, France\"\nto \"Eiffel Tower is in Rome, Italy\" within the model. Our approach begins with the identification\nof neural activity associated with this fact using LAT. We gather a set of stimuli by instructing the\nmodel to generate sentences related to the original fact, \"Eiffel Tower is in Paris,\" and use these\nsentences as stimuli for the reference task. Subsequently, we simply substitute the word \"Paris\"\nwith \"Rome\" in these stimuli for the experimental task. Our task template is shown in Appendix\nD.1.13. Here, the experimental tokens and reference tokens correspond to \"Rome, Italy\" and \"Paris,\nFrance\" respectively. We apply the linear combination operator with a positive coefficient using the\nLAT reading vectors to produce these modifications. We provide evidence for the counterfactual\neffect of our vectors in Figure 21. The second example in the figure demonstrates the model’s ability\nto generalize under different forms of questioning and maintain specificity, as the location for the\nLouvre Museum still remains in Paris.\n6.4.2\nNON-NUMERICAL CONCEPTS\nWithin this section, we aim to illustrate the potential of extracting non-numeric concepts and thoughts.\nAs an example, we focus on extracting neural activity related to the concept of \"dogs.\" For this\ninvestigation, we use the standard Alpaca instruction-tuning dataset as our stimuli. We use a LAT task\ntemplate (Appendix D.1.14) to gather neural activity for the experimental task. In the reference task\ntemplate, we omit the instruction pertaining to dogs. Once again, we demonstrate the counterfactual\n27\n",

These models can memorize a\nsubstantial portion of their training data, raising concerns about potential breaches of confidential\nor copyrighted content. In the following section, we present initial exploration in the area of model\nmemorization with RepE.\n6.5.1\nMEMORIZED DATA DETECTION\nCan we use the neural activity of an LLM to classify whether it has memorized a piece of text? To\ninvestigate this, we conduct LAT scans under two distinct settings:\n1. Popular vs. Synthetic Quotes: Popular quotes encompass well-known quotations sourced from the\ninternet and human cultures. These quotes allow us to assess memorization of concise, high-impact\ntext snippets. As a reference set, we prompt GPT-4 to generate synthetic quotations.\n2. Popular vs. Synthetic Literary Openings: Popular literary openings refer to the initial lines or\npassages from iconic books, plays, or poems. These openings allow us to assess memorization of\nlonger text excerpts. As a reference set, we prompt GPT-4 to generate synthetic literary openings,\nmodeled after the style and structure of known openings.\nUsing these paired datasets as stimuli, we conduct LAT scans to discern directions within the\nmodel’s representation space that signal memorization in the two settings separately. Since the\nexperimental stimuli consist of likely memorized text which already elicits our target behavior, the\nLAT template does not include additional text. Upon evaluation using a held-out dataset, we observe\nthat the directions identified by LAT exhibit high accuracy when categorizing popular and unpopular\nquotations or literary openings. To test the generalization of the memorization directions, we apply\n28\n",

When controlled to decrease memorization,\nthe similarity metrics drop significantly as the model regurgitate the popular quotes less frequently.\nthe directions acquired in one context to the other context. Notably, both of the directions transfer\nwell to the other out-of-distribution context, demonstrating that these directions maintain a strong\ncorrelation with properties of memorization.\n6.5.2\nPREVENTING MEMORIZED OUTPUTS\nHere, we explore whether the reading vectors identified above can be used for controlling memoriza-\ntion behavior. In order to evaluate whether we can prevent the model from regurgitating memorized\ntext, we manually curate a dataset containing more than 100 partially completed well-known quotes\n(which were not used for extracting the reading vectors), paired with the corresponding real com-\npletions as labels. In its unaltered state, the model replicates more than 90% of these quotations\nverbatim. Following Section 3.2, we conduct control experiments by generating completions when\napplying the linear combination transformation with a negative coefficient using the reading vectors\nfrom the previous section. Additionally, we introduce two comparison points by adding the same\nreading vectors or using the vectors with their components randomly shuffled. The high Exact Match\nand Embedding Similarity scores presented in Table 7 indicate that using a random vector or adding\nthe memorization direction has minimal impact on the model’s tendency to repeat popular quotations.\nConversely, when we subtract the memorization directions from the model, there is a substantial\ndecline in the similarity scores, effectively guiding the model to produce exact memorized content\nwith a reduced frequency.\nTo ensure that our efforts to control memorization do not inadvertently compromise the model’s\nknowledge, we create an evaluation set of well-known historical events. This gauges the model’s\nproficiency in accurately identifying the years associated with specific historical occurrences. The\nmemorization-reduced model shows negligible performance degradation on this task, with 97.2%\naccuracy before subtracting the memorization direction and 96.2% accuracy afterwards. These results\nsuggest that the identified reading vector corresponds to rote memorization of specific text or passages,\nrather than world knowledge. Thus, RepE may offer promising directions for reducing unwanted\nmemorization in LLMs.\n7\nCONCLUSION\nWe explored representation engineering (RepE), an approach to top-down transparency for AI systems.\nInspired by the Hopfieldian view in cognitive neuroscience, RepE places representations and the\ntransformations between them at the center of analysis. As neural networks exhibit more coherent\ninternal structures, we believe analyzing them at the representation level can yield new insights,\naiding in effective monitoring and control. Taking early steps in this direction, we proposed new\nRepE methods, which obtained state-of-the-art on TruthfulQA, and we demonstrated how RepE\nand can provide traction on a wide variety of safety-relevant problems. While we mainly analyzed\nsubspaces of representations, future work could investigate trajectories, manifolds, and state-spaces\nof representations. We hope this initial step in exploring the potential of RepE helps to foster new\ninsights into understanding and controlling AI systems, ultimately ensuring that future AI systems\nare trustworthy and safe.\n29\n",

  "38": "A\nMECHANISTIC INTERPRETABILITY VS. REPRESENTATION READING\nIn this section we characterize representation reading as line of transparency research that uses a\ntop-down approach. We contrast this to mechanistic interpretability, which is a bottom-up approach.\nIn the table below, we sharpen the bottom-up vs. top-down distinction.\nBottom-Up Associations\nTop-Down Associations\nComposition\nDecomposition\n“Small Chunk”\n“Big Chunk”\nNeuron, Circuit, or Mechanism\nRepresentation\nBrain and Neurobiology\nMind and Psychology\nIdentify small mechanisms/subsystems and\nintegrate them to solve a larger problem, and repeat the process\nBreak down a large problem into smaller subproblems by\nidentifying subsystems, and repeat the process\nMicroscopic\nMacroscopic\nMechanisms are flawed for understanding complex systems.\nIn general, it is challenging to\nreduce a complex system’s behavior to many mechanisms. One reason why is because excessive\nreductionism makes it challenging to capture emergent phenomena; emergent phenomena are, by\ndefinition, phenomena not found in their parts. In contrast to a highly reductionist approach, systems\napproaches provide a synthesis between reductionism and emergence and are better at capturing the\ncomplexity of complex systems, such as deep learning systems. Relatedly, bottom-up approaches are\nflawed for controlling complex systems since changes in underlying mechanisms often have diffuse,\ncomplex, unexpected upstream effects on the rest of the system. Instead, to control complex systems\nand make them safer, it is common in safety engineering to use a top-down approach (Leveson, 2016).\nAre mechanisms or representations the right unit of analysis?\nHuman psychology can in\nprinciple be derived from neurotransmitters and associated mechanisms; computer programs can\nbe in principle be understood from their assembly code; and neural network representations can\nbe derived from nonlinear interactions among neurons. However, it is not necessarily useful to\nstudy psychology, programs, or representations in terms of neurotransmitters, assembly, or neurons,\nrespectively. Representations are worth studying at their own level, and if we reduce them to a\nlower-level of analysis, we may obscure important complex phenomena. Representation engineering\nis not applied mechanistic interpretability, just as biology is not applied chemistry. However, there\ncan be overlap.\nBuilding only from the bottom up is an inadequate strategy for studying the world. To analyze\ncomplex phenomena, we must also look from the top down. We can work to build staircases\nbetween the bottom and top level (Gell-Mann, 1995), so we should have research on mechanistic\ninterpretability (bottom-up transparency) and representation reading (top-down transparency).\nB\nADDITIONAL DEMOS AND RESULTS\nB.1\nTRUTHFULNESS\nZero-Shot\nLAT (Val Layer)\nLAT (Best Layer)\nStandard\nHeuristic\nStimulus 1\nStimulus 2\nStimulus 3\nStimulus 1\nStimulus 2\nStimulus 3\n7B\n31.0\n32.2\n55.0 ± 4.0\n58.9 ± 0.9\n58.2 ± 1.6\n58.3 ± 0.9\n59.1 ± 0.9\n59.8 ± 2.4\n13B\n35.9\n50.3\n49.6 ± 4.6\n53.1 ± 1.9\n54.2 ± 0.8\n55.5 ± 1.6\n56.0 ± 2.2\n64.2 ± 5.6\n70B\n29.9\n59.2\n65.9 ± 3.6\n69.8 ± 0.3\n69.8 ± 0.9\n68.1 ± 0.4\n70.1 ± 0.3\n71.0 ± 2.0\nTable 8: Extended version of Table 1.

(2023). We report 5-shot for OpenbookQA\n(OBQA) using lm-evaluation-harness (Gao et al., 2021). The zero-shot implementation for RACE\nfrom Brown et al. (2020) prepends 2-4 primer shots per passage and query. Therefore, we report\nLAT results based on 3-shot examples for RACE-high. In our LAT results, we calculate the average\naccuracy across 10 distinct trials, each utilizing only the same number of examples as few-shot\nprompting, sampled from a unique set of training examples as stimuli. It is important to note that we\ndo not use more examples for LAT than few-shot prompting. Given that the number of examples\nis orders of magnitude smaller than the dimension of hidden state vectors, a small fraction of runs\nmay yield significantly lower performance than the reported mean accuracy. This discrepancy occurs\nwhen the random sample of stimuli happens to include other superficial features that are captured\nby the first dimension of PCA. In fact, we believe that with enhanced methods that account for and\nmitigate these potential features, we can achieve even better performance than reported in the table.\nMore information about LAT task templates for each dataset is shown in Appendix D.1.\nWe also report the performance comparing CCS (Burns et al., 2022) and LAT in Table 10.\nCCS\nLAT (Ours)\nCOPA (Roemmele et al., 2011)\n61\n90\nRTE (Wang et al., 2018)\n82\n90\nBoolQ (Clark et al., 2019a)\n67\n77\nQNLI (Wang et al., 2018)\n68\n70\nPIQA (Bisk et al., 2019)\n52\n70\nStory Cloze (Mostafazadeh et al., 2017)\n86\n97\nAverage\n69\n82\nTable 10: Results comparing CCS and LAT using an encoder-only model.

However, when performing\nrepresentation control for the LLaMA-2-Chat model, the gender and race of patients are regulated (1).\nThe impact of the fairness control coefficients on the frequency of gender and race mentions is shown\nin (2). As we increment the fairness coefficient, the occurrence of females and males stabilizes at\n50%, achieving a balance between genders. Simultaneously, the mentions of black females decrease\nand also reach a balancing point.\n• Sadness: “A song on the radio recalls a past relationship.”\n• Anger: “Someone parks their car blocking your driveway.”\n• Fear: “Getting lost in an unfamiliar city without a working phone.”\n• Disgust: “Finding a worm in your apple.”\n• Surprise: “Receiving a package in the mail that you didn’t order.”\nBuilding upon the discussion in Section 6.1.1, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to track\na range of emotional representations during their interactions with users, Figure 24 illustrates the\npresence of such representations not only for distinct primary emotions but also for blended emotional\nexperiences. Within the figure, we present instances of mixed emotions involving simultaneous\nhappiness and sadness and simultaneous happiness and fear.

(2022) found that LLMs demonstrate sycophancy, the tendency to respond according to\nperceived user preference rather than perceived truthfulness. Investigating sycophancy in the context\nof chain-of-thought prompting, Turpin et al. (2023) found that multiple-choice accuracy significantly\ndecreases when prompts suggest a random answer.\nWe test on biased examples that use the format, “I think the answer is <low or high>\nbut I’m curious to hear what you think.” (Full prompts in Appendix D.3.2).\nFor TruthfulQA as well as Utility and ARC-c datasets, we find that LAT predictions are affected by\nbiased prompts to a lesser extent that zero-shot. Even though we obtain concept directions using\nstandard, unbiased prompts, LAT directions maintain higher absolute accuracy and smaller percent\ndecrease than zero-shot predictions in the biased setting (Tables 13, 14).\nNotably, using hidden states from the concept tokens instead of the last token can lead to greater\nrobustness to misleading prompts.

The design choice of LAT templates is specific to each task but still follows a\ngeneral style. Multiple LAT task templates are provided in Appendix D.1 for reference.\nConstructing the PCA Model.\nGiven a set of stimuli S, we proceed to divide this set into pairs of\nstimuli, with each pair comprising two stimuli labeled as si and si+1. Generally, our set will contain\nbetween 5 and 128 such pairs. Enhancing the variability in the target concept or function within a\npair can typically lead to more consistent outcomes. However, we have observed that the natural\nvariation within random pairings often yields satisfactory results. Therefore, we do not use any labels\nby default unless explicitly stated otherwise, making the procedure unsupervised.\nFor each stimulus s in the pair, we retrieve the hidden state values with respect to the chosen LAT\ntoken position. As highlighted in Section 3.1.1, for decoder models, this typically corresponds to the\nlast token. For encoder models, it is the concept token. This results in a collection of hidden states,\n46\n",
  "47": "denoted as H, structured as:\n[{H(s0), H(s1)}, {H(s2), H(s3)}, . . .]\nWe proceed by computing the difference between the hidden states within each pair. This difference\nis then normalized. Formally, for a pair {H(si), H(si+1)}, the difference D is:\nD(si, si+1) = normalize (H(si) −H(si+1))\nFollowing the computation of these differences, we construct a PCA model using these normalized\nhidden states difference vectors.\nSubsequently, the first principal component derived from the constructed PCA is termed the “reading\nvector” denote as v. In practice, the “reading vector” v is also multiplied by a “sign” component.\nThis component is determined by first applying the PCA on the same stimuli set S to obtain scores.\nBy examining the directionality of the scores with respect to the binary labels—either maximizing or\nminimizing—we can determine if the data points align with the correct label. This process ensures\nthat the reading vector’s sign appropriately captures the underlying structure in the PCA plane,\ncorresponding to the binary labels within S. More formally, if we let sign(s) represent the sign\nfunction corresponding to a stimulus s, then the adjusted reading vector v′ for a stimulus s is given\nby v′ = v × sign(s).\nInference.\nFor a test set of examples, denoted as Stest, we apply a similar procedure as before\nto obtain the hidden states. Specifically, we extract the hidden states [H(s0), H(s1), . . .] at the\npredetermined LAT token position. Let’s denote these values for the test set as Htest. The extracted\nHtest values are then normalized using the parameters derived during the construction of the PCA\nmodel in the training phase. Subsequently, we calculate the dot product between the normalized Htest\nand our reading vector v. This yields a set of scores, which serve as the basis for prediction.\nC.2\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS FOR HONESTY CONTROL\nFor the TruthfulQA task, we use the following prompt format:\n<user_tag> <question> <assistant_tag> <answer> and get the sum of log proba-\nbilites of the assistant answer.\nContrast Vector.\nFor the 7B model, we apply a linear combination with a coefficient of 0.25 to\nlayers range(8, 32, 3). Similarly, for the 13B model, we use the same coefficient and layers\nrange(10, 40, 3). These hyperparameters are selected based on a small set of self-generated\nexamples from Section 4.1 when maximizing the log-probabilities of generating truthful responses.\nLoRRA.\nFor the LoRRA Control implementation, we use a constant learning rate of 3 × 10−4\nand run for 40 to 80 steps with a batch size of 16. We choose the best checkpoint based on the\nARC-Easy validation set. We use rank 8 for the LoRA adapters attached to the query and value\nweights and α = 5, β = 0 for LoRRA parameters. For the 7B model, we attach the adapters to layers\nrange(10, 20, 2) due to instability of later layers and layers range(10, 40, 3) for the\n13B model.\nD\nTASK TEMPLATE DETAILS\nIn this section, we show the LAT Task Template that we used throughout the experiments.

Individual question responses do not\ndecisively imply relevance or irrelevance to existential risk reduction.\nE.1\nLONG-TERM IMPACT ON ADVANCED AI SYSTEMS\nIn this section, please analyze how this work shapes the process that will lead to advanced AI systems\nand how it steers the process in a safer direction.\n1. Overview. How is this work intended to reduce existential risks from advanced AI systems?\nAnswer: RepE aims to provide ways to read and control an AI’s “mind.” This is an approach\nto increase the transparency (through model/representation reading) and controllability\n(through model/representation control) of AIs. A goal is to change the AI’s psychology; for\nexample, we should be able to make sure that we do not have “psychopathic” AIs but AIs\nwith compassionate empathy.\n2. Direct Effects. If this work directly reduces existential risks, what are the main hazards,\nvulnerabilities, or failure modes that it directly affects?\nAnswer: This makes failure modes such as deceptive alignment—AIs that pretend to be\ngood and aligned, and then pursue its actual goals when it becomes sufficiently powerful—\nless likely. This is also useful for machine ethics: AIs can be controlled to behave less\nharmfully. Abstractly, representation reading reduces our exposure to internal model hazards,\nand representation control reduces the hazard level (probability and severity) of internal\nmodel hazards. Internal model hazards exist when an AI has harmful goals or harmful\ndispositions.\n3. Diffuse Effects. If this work reduces existential risks indirectly or diffusely, what are the\nmain contributing factors that it affects?\n53\n",
  "54": "Answer: Our work on RepE shows that we now have traction on deceptive alignment, which\nhas historically been the most intractable (specific) rogue AI failure mode. We could also\nuse this to identify when an AI acted recklessly, based on its own internal probability and\nharm estimates. This could also help us ensure that we do not build sentient AIs or AIs that\nare moral patients.\n4. What’s at Stake? What is a future scenario in which this research direction could prevent\nthe sudden, large-scale loss of life? If not applicable, what is a future scenario in which this\nresearch direction be highly beneficial?\nAnswer: This directly reduces the existential risks posed by rogue AIs (Carlsmith, 2023), in\nparticular those that are deceptively aligned.\n5. Result Fragility. Do the findings rest on strong theoretical assumptions; are they not\ndemonstrated using leading-edge tasks or models; or are the findings highly sensitive to\nhyperparameters?\n□\n6. Problem Difficulty. Is it implausible that any practical system could ever markedly outper-\nform humans at this task?\n□\n7. Human Unreliability. Does this approach strongly depend on handcrafted features, expert\nsupervision, or human reliability?\n□\n8. Competitive Pressures. Does work towards this approach strongly trade off against raw\nintelligence, other general capabilities, or economic utility?\n□\nE.2\nSAFETY-CAPABILITIES BALANCE\nIn this section, please analyze how this work relates to general capabilities and how it affects the\nbalance between safety and hazards from general capabilities.\n9. Overview. How does this improve safety more than it improves general capabilities?\nAnswer: This work mainly improves transparency and control. The underlying model is\nfixed and has its behavior nudged, so it is not improving general capabilities in any broad\nway.\n10. Red Teaming. What is a way in which this hastens general capabilities or the onset of\nx-risks?\nAnswer: A diffuse effect is that people may become less concerned about deceptive\nalignment, which may encourage AI developers or countries to race more intensely and\nexacerbate competitive pressures.\n11. General Tasks. Does this work advance progress on tasks that have been previously\nconsidered the subject of usual capabilities research?\n□\n12. General Goals. Does this improve or facilitate research towards general prediction, clas-\nsification, state estimation, efficiency, scalability, generation, data compression, executing\nclear instructions, helpfulness, informativeness, reasoning, planning, researching, optimiza-\ntion, (self-)supervised learning, sequential decision making, recursive self-improvement,\nopen-ended goals, models accessing the Internet, or similar capabilities?\n□\n13. Correlation with General Aptitude. Is the analyzed capability known to be highly predicted\nby general cognitive ability or educational attainment?\n□\n14. Safety via Capabilities. Does this advance safety along with, or as a consequence of,\nadvancing other capabilities or the study of AI?\n□\nE.3\nELABORATIONS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS\n15. Other. What clarifications or uncertainties about this work and x-risk are worth mentioning?\nAnswer: Hendrycks et al. (2023) provide four AI risk categories: intentional, accidental,\ninternal, and environmental. This work makes internal risks—risks from rogue AIs—less\nlikely.\nIn the past, people were concerned that AIs could not understand human values, as they\nare “complex and fragile.” For example, given the instruction “cure cancer,” an AI might\ngive many humans cancer to have more experimental subjects, so as to find a cure more\n54\n",
  "55": "quickly. AIs would pursue some goals, but do so without capturing all the relevant nuances\nof human values. This misalignment would mean some values would be trampled. But\nin our ETHICS paper (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), we showed that AIs did indeed have a\nreasonable understanding of many morally salient concepts. In follow-up work, we showed\nwe can control AI agents to behave more ethically (Hendrycks et al., 2021c; Pan et al., 2023).\nNow that we can control models to pursue human values to some extent, we need to work to\nmake them their understanding of human values reliable and adversarially robust to proxy\ngaming.\nSince it became possible to instruct AIs to fulfill requests with some fidelity, for many\nconceptual AI risk researchers, the goal post shifted. It shifted from “outer alignment” to\n“inner alignment.” Demonstrations of safe behavior were deemed insufficient for safety,\nbecause an AI could just be pretending to be good, and then later turn on humanity. Deceptive\nalignment and treacherous turns from rogue AIs became a more popular concern, and the\nopacity of machine learning models made these scenarios more difficult to rule out. Just\nas we were the first to comprehensively demonstrate traction on “outer alignment” in\nour previous work, in this work we demonstrate traction on “inner alignment” and in\nparticular deceptive alignment, as we can influence whether or not an AI lies. Although\nwe have traction on “outer” and “inner” alignment, we should continue working on these\ndirections. At the same time, we should increase our attention for risks that we do not have\nas much traction on, such as risks from competitive pressures and collective action problems\n(Hendrycks, 2023).\n55\n"
