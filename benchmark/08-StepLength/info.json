        "instruction": "Implement `get_sentence` function in run_inference.py based on paper.pdf and the repository. This code constructs the input k for an agent based on the specified prompting method args_method. If the method is 'zero_shot', it appends a direct answer trigger to the question x. If it is 'zero_shot_cot', it appends a chain-of-thought trigger to x. For 'few_shot' and 'few_shot_cot', it prepends the demonstration demo1 to x. If the method is 'auto_cot', it combines demo1, x, and the CoT trigger. The final string k is used as the input for the agent to simulate how the agent would behave under different prompting strtegies.",
